    At Florida CMS T2, we  need to move two
    ( cms.rc.ufl.edu and osg.rc.ufl.edu ) of our 3 CEs to use the new Lustre file system.
    I need to shut them down immediately.
    The need for the immediate shutdown is due to the continuing SAM test  failures
    due to the stageout issue as the new Lustre filesystem is not available.
    The ETA of them is not easy to predict. So, I will let you know when the CE becomes
    available.
