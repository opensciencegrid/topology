AppDescription: 'One of the most powerful approaches for interpretation of genomes
  and understanding mechanisms of adaptation of organisms to environments is comparative
  and evolutionary analysis of wide spectrum of phylogenetically diverse organisms.
  It allows for systematic exploration of adaptive mechanisms that led to diversification
  of biological systems, on all levels of their organization: genomic, metabolic,
  and phenotypic. However such approach requires the development of high-throughput
  computational environments that integrate (i) large amounts of genomic and experimental
  data (ii) powerful tools and algorithms for knowledge discovery and data mining
  (iii) tools for collaborative analysis of biological data by the experts residing
  in remote locations and (iv) scalable computational backend. GADU is a high-performance
  scalable computational system that allows efficient automation of the major steps
  of genome analysis, including data acquisition from a variety of genomic databases
  and its analysis by several bioinformatics tools and algorithms. GADU utilizes Grid
  technology for the needs of high-throughput genetic sequence analysis. Using GADU,
  publicly available bioinformatics tools like BLAST, BLOCKS, Pfam, TMHMM etc. are
  executed parallely on the Grid and results are then stored in an integrated relational
  database. Apart from using the results for further refined analysis, they are also
  used to display through web applications for the use of the bioinformatics community.'

Community: This project proposes to develop and support the infrastructure needed
  to permit wide-scale use of the Open Science Grid (OSG) by the computational biology
  community through the integrated database maintained by the Argonne\'s Bioinformatics
  Group and the user facilities which continue to grow around that database.
