AppDescription: The main categories of applications are event simulation, data reconstruction,
  and data analysis. Applications are data and CPU intensive, consisting of a few
  GBytes of input/output per batch process. The typical volume of batch jobs submitted
  through the grid is a few thousand per day. The average local storage space needed
  for I/O management is a few GB per worker node. The typical required scratch space
  at the worker node is 5 GB per job.

Community: The D0 experiment is a high energy physics experiment collecting data at
  the FNAL Tevatron.  The VO associated with the D0 collaboration wishes to use OSG
  resources to reconstruct the raw data from the detector into physics objects and
  to produce large samples of Monte Carlo generated data of physical processes to
  create simulated events samples as they would appear in the D0 Detector.  Such samples
  are essential to calculate the efficiency for detection of the various processes
  in the sample of collider data.
