AppDescription: 'The most CPU intensive application is CS-ROSETTA, that allows structure
  determination of proteins based on chemical shift

  information alone. It thus bypasses the need for NOE based distance restraints,
  which usually require

  considerable time to obtain. Further advantages of using chemical shifts are that
  these are among the

  most reliable parameters that can be obtained from NMR spectroscopy and that they
  can potentially be

  obtained for larger macromolecules for which NOEs become impractical. On the other
  hand, direct

  chemical shift based structure determination is computationally much more expensive
  than structure

  calculations using distance restraints.  However, the most time consuming part of
  a CS-ROSETTA run

  consists of a large number of independent calculations that can be easily distributed
  over the GRID.'
