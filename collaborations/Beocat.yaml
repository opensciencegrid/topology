AppDescription: Due to our goal of being a campus resource for scientific research,
  determining the applications that each and every user would run on our cluster is
  impossible. Users that need to use OSG resources would be more appropriately vetted
  to determine suitability for using the OSG stack.
CertificateOnly: false
Community: The Beocat Cluster is committed to enabling scientific progress at Kansas
  State University and similar facilities.
