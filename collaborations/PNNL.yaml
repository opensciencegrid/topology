AppDescription: PNNL provides grid-enabled CPU and storage for external and internal
  users.
CertificateOnly: false
Community: The Pacific Northwest National Laboratory VO serves different user communities
  in High Energy and Nuclear Physics. In addition to users on collaborations that
  are already grid-enabled, we support smaller experiments with a possibly short life
  time that would like to take advantage of our grid-enabled infrastructure.
