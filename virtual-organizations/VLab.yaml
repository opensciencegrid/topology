AppDescription: "VLab plans to run Quantum Espresso jobs of thermodynamics, thermoelastic\
  \ proprieties and elastic constant in Bag of Task. \nPrimarily we will use PWscf\
  \ and Phonon software from Quantum Espresso package."
CertificateOnly: 'True'
Community: "VLab makes contribution for communities of Geophysics (Mineral Physics),\
  \ Physics, Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Material Science, and Quantum Espresso\
  \ user community. \nResults obtained VLab on thermodynamics and thermoelastic properties\
  \ of major mineral phases are directly applicable to the analysis of seismic tomography\
  \ images and are necessary for geodynamics simulations, therefore, will have significant\
  \ interdisciplinary impact."
