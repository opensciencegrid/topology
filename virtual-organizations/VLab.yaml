AppDescription: 'VLab plans to run Quantum Espresso jobs of thermodynamics, thermoelastic
  proprieties and elastic constant in Bag of Task.

  Primarily we will use PWscf and Phonon software from Quantum Espresso package.'
CertificateOnly: true
Community: 'VLab makes contribution for communities of Geophysics (Mineral Physics),
  Physics, Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Material Science, and Quantum Espresso
  user community.

  Results obtained VLab on thermodynamics and thermoelastic properties of major mineral
  phases are directly applicable to the analysis of seismic tomography images and
  are necessary for geodynamics simulations, therefore, will have significant interdisciplinary
  impact.'
