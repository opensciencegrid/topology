Active: true
AppDescription: Common applications are molecular dynamics simulations (namd, gromacs,
  amber, charmm), protein docking or folding (haddock, rosetta), image processing
  (frealign), and molecular replacement (molrep, phaser).
CertificateOnly: false
Community: Structural biology focuses primarily on the study of molecular structure
  of proteins and nucleic acids and the association of structure and function.  The
  community has significant data and processing requirements originating from large
  data sets resulting from various forms of macromolecular imaging techniques (X-ray
  cyrstallography, electron-microscopy, and NMR), as well as simulation and modeling
  algorithms for protein folding, docking, structure determination, and dynamics.
