Community: The SURAgrid user community consists of researchers from member organizations
  who work in disciplines such as Physics, Chemistry, Biochemistry, Bioinformatics,
  Biomedicine, and Computer Science.  SURAgrid's goals are (1) to develop a scalable
  infrastructure that leverages local institutional identity and authorization while
  managing access to shared resources across institutional boundaries; (2) to promote
  the use of this infrastructure for the broad research and education community, creating
  a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts; and (3) to provide a forum for
  participating institutions to gain additional experience with grid technology and
  to promote collaborative project development.
