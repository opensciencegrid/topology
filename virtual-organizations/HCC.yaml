AppDescription: While HCC has a strong affiliation with the US CMS project as a Tier-2
  site, we have recently had a growing number of local users inquire about accessing
  the considerable resources of the Open Science Grid.  We have utilized both OSG-MM
  and glideinWMS to develop workflows for local users running a variety of bioinformatics
  utilities, including autodock and rosetta.  HCC supports interfaces to local machines
  named Firefly and Prairiefire that provide a combined 6000 processors  for opportunistic
  use to the OSG with local HCC staff. The HCC VO will allow us to engage a growing
  Nebraska user community, and to monitor and assist these NU researchers as they
  migrate their code to OSG.

Community: HCC supports NU faculty and staff from a variety of fields and 4 campuses
