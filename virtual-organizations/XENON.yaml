Community: 'The Xenon VO xenon.biggrid.nl is the incubator grid community for work
  on the

  international Xenon 1T and related experiments in the search for dark matter. Members
  of the

  VO will work to build, understand and analyse the detector and results related to
  the Xenon

  experiment and to "Monte-Carlo" studies that will be used to design, build and

  understand the detector, as well as work with the supporting computing infrastructure
  to make this happen.'
