Community: 'The Fermi collaboration operates the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (FGST,
  formerly GLAST, Gamma-ray Large Area Space Telescope) on board of the Fermi satellite.
  The collaboration is international, composed of members of research institutions
  and universities of U.S.A, Italy, Germany, France, Sweden, and Japan. The satellite
  was launched from Cape Canaveral on June 11, 2008. On board of FGST there are two
  scientific experiments. The Large Area Telescope detects gamma-rays in the energy
  range from 20 MeV to 300 GeV, with very good position resolution (<10 arcmins),
  and an energy resolution in the range of 10%. Complementary, the GLAST Burst Monitor
  is sensitive in the range from 8 keV to 25 MeV. Together, they cover 25 octaves
  of the electromagnetic spectrum, with large angular acceptances. High energy gamma-rays
  are tracers of the most extreme environments in the universe. Objects on the list
  to study are: gamma-ray bursts, active galactic nuclei, solar flares, and pulsars,
  pulsar wind nebulae, and supernova remnants. Moreover, FGST could resolve the nature
  of dark matter, and is sensitive to effects proposed by theories extending the standard
  model of particle physics, like quantum-gravity.'
