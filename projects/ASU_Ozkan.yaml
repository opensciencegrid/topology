Description: In this research, we are trying to study and calculate the
  binding free energy of protein complexes with large peptides. The
  strategy is to apply constant velocity pulling on peptides based on
  NAMD simulations and statistically calculate the binding free energy
  by applying Jarzynskis equality.
