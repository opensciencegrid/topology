Description: 'My research focuses on detecting patterns in physiological data of patients
  in an Intensive Care Unit setting, with the aim of constructing an early warning
  system.  The approach I am taking includes machine learning algorithms such as Artificial
  Neural Networks, Hidden Markov Models, and Support Vector Machines.  I presently
  have limited computational resources for which to conduct this research.  The data
  I am using for training and validation is both static and time based information
  on 32,000 patients and includes approximately 30GB of raw data.  Additionally I
  have extremely high resolution data on 2,600 patient.  The search-space is prohibitively
  large for a single computer and even some of the smaller clusters.


  I am employing an optimization methodology which allows for a differential evolution
  approach to incrementally improve a structurally adaptive model.   The methodology
  allows for parallel programming which is of course a necessity for distributed computing.'
