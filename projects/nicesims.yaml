Description: The Nice Model, is an evolutionary model for the outer Solar System which
  has explained many puzzling observed qualities of the Solar System. As the newly
  formed planets cleared debris from the young Solar System, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune
  tended to scatter objects inward, while Jupiter ejected these planetesimals out
  of the Solar System. To conserve angular momentum through this process, Jupiter
  slowly migrates inward while the other giant planets move outward. When Jupiter
  and Saturn cross a period of orbital resonance, the entire Solar System experiences
  a massive instability. We will run simulations to probe the affect of such an instability
  on an evolving system of inner planets.
