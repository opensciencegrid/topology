Description: "Linkage disequilibrium's contribution to the maintenance of sexual reproduction\n\
  \nThough sexual reproduction is nearly ubiquitous in nature, its costs are substantial.\
  \ Foremost among these costs are the twofold cost of males and the cost of destroying\
  \ successful genetic associations. Understanding the paradox of the persistence\
  \ of sex despite these detriments is a central question in evolutionary theory.\
  \ In order to persist regardless of these disadvantages, the benefits of sexual\
  \ reproduction must be substantial - offspring of sexual reproduction must have\
  \ at least twice the fitness of asexual clones. The most generalizable hypotheses\
  \ addressing the benefits of sex propose that genetic drift increases linkage disequilibrium,\
  \ creating a surfeit of genomes with intermediate fitness. Sexual recombination\
  \ eliminates linkage disequilibrium, thereby increasing genetic variation for fitness\
  \ and improving the efficiency of natural selection. However, previous research\
  \ using this framework has failed to address the biological reality of interactions\
  \ between genes. Because the cost of destroying beneficial genetic interactions\
  \ is one of the major costs of sex, this cannot be overlooked. In this work, I use\
  \ a computational gene network model in which genes interact and genetic interactions\
  \ evolve to investigate the hypothesis that linkage disequilibrium decreases the\
  \ fitness and adaptability of asexual populations. I test this both by evolving\
  \ artificial organisms in conditions that will increase linkage disequilibrium,\
  \ and by evolving them in an environment with a shifting optimum, which will make\
  \ linkage disequilibrium more costly. \n\nI am running a python script that runs\
  \ populations of artificial gene networks (numerical matrices) through repeated\
  \ rounds (on the order of 10s of thousands) of mutation, selection and reproduction,\
  \ analyzing the evolutionary dynamics of these populations, and storing the data\
  \ generated by this in text files."
