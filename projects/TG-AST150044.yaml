Description: "We are requesting 1,700,000 SUs on Open Science Grid to model the initial\
  \ conditions of a sample of 15 major galaxy mergers in the local universe. These\
  \ measurements will place unique constraints on the role of galaxy mergers in shaping\
  \ galaxy evolution, and on cosmological assembly. Our sample consists of 15 interacting\
  \ galaxy pairs with H\u03B1 kinematic maps, 2 of which have both H\u03B1 and HI\
  \ 2D kinematic maps and 3 of which are drawn from the SDSSIV MaNGA survey. We will\
  \ use the Identikit software package (Barnes & Hibbard 2009; Barnes 2011) and our\
  \ automated pipeline to model the dynamics of interacting galaxy pairs and constrain\
  \ their initial orbital parameters and merger stage."
