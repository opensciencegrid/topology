Description: This proposal is a request for supercomputer resources to carry out computations
  on five projects. The first project is to study the dynamics of a monoamine transporter
  in a novel single bilayer system. In this project we are investigating the resetting
  of the transporter through the movement of potassium ions. The second project is
  to calculate binding free energies for proposed antidepressant analogs that bind
  to serotonin. The third project is to investigate the aggregation properties of
  polyQ peptides. The fourth project is to study the electronic properties of diamond-like
  semiconductors using band structure methods. The fifth project is to apply quantum
  monte carlo methods to the study of water dimers and clusters.
