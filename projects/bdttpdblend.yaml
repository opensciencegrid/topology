Department: Material Science and Engineering
Description: We will utilize the Open Science Grid to conduct quantum chemical calculations
  and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of organic photovoltaic morphologies. We have
  a simulation pipeline that enables high throughput material screening for chemistires
  and processing conditions relevent for organic photovoltaic devices. We will use
  molecular configurations from previously simulated morphologies, generated with
  molecular dynamics code accelerated by GPUs.
