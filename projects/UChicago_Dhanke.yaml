Description: My research focuses on the application of Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs)
  for uncertainty estimation in medical image classification, particularly in analyzing
  Chest X-ray datasets. By integrating advanced deep learning techniques with Bayesian
  inference methods, I aim to enhance the reliability of AI-assisted diagnostics in
  healthcare.
