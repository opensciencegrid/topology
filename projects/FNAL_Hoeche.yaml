Description:  Sherpa is a Monte Carlo event generator for the Simulation of
  High-Energy Reactions of PArticles in lepton-lepton, lepton-photon,
  photon-photon, lepton-hadron and hadron-hadron collisions. Simulation
  programs - also dubbed event generators - are indispensable computational
  tools for particle physics phenomenology and are the interface between
  theory and experiment.
