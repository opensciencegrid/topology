Description: Biomolecular interactions have been core pillars of our
    research. We are involved in developing and applying new
    computational technologies and offering a rational
    computational-based approach to the study of protein systems and
    the discovery of novel therapeutic agents (e.g. antibodies),
    biomarkers, and proteins for specific applications including
    key disease-related protein mechanisms.
