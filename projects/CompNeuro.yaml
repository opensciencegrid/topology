Description: 'To give you a brief idea, I am trying to identify the information flow

  among several brain regions in rats in the neuronal level. The rats

  were actively doing a aperture discrimination task (whether a gate

  opened wide or narrow).  I wish to find not only the static neuronal

  circuitry of the sensory input, but also the dynamics of the flow

  across time.'
