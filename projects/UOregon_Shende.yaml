Description: The project will evaluate the feasibility of using
  Singularity containers from the Extreme-scale Scientific Software Stack
  (E4S)[https://e4s.io] in the Open Science Grid to support HPC and
  AI/ML workflows. E4S includes support for 100+ HPC products (e.g., TAU,
  Trilinos, PETSc, OpenMPI, MPICH, Kokkos, HDF5) and AI/ML products (e.g.,
  TensorFlow, PyTorch) optimized for GPUs from three vendors (Intel,
  AMD, and NVIDIA). It supports LLVM compilers, vendor compilers (NVHPC,
  oneAPI, ROCm hipcc), on multiple architectures (including x86_64,
  ppc64le, and aarch64).
