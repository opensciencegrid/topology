Description: Modern day software and robotics are notorious for lacking robustness
  and adaptability, often breaking down when encountering unexpected situations. Natural
  animals, on the other hand, are well known for their robustness and their ability
  to adapt to new environments. The Evolving Artificial Intelligence project aims
  to study how the robustness and adaptability of natural animals evolved, both to
  learn more about natural evolution, and to increase the robustness and adaptability
  of modern software and robotics systems.
