Description: Allocations to help UD clients understand what resources
  can potentially be available to them to extend and/or complement
  UDs local HPC resources. Our goal is to apply for startup or other
  types of allocations for clients without necessarily using the 
  Campus Champion resource, and/or provide clients with access to one
  of the resources, like Bridges, via the workshops to get a sense of
  resources and then apply for their own allocation. These allocations
  will be offered as an option to our UD clients to experiment in
  anticipation of applying for their own allocations.
