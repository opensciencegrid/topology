Description: "Designing Inhibitors of SARS-CoV 2 Spike Protein Folding

The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV 2 Spike (S) protein
 plays a crucial role in enabling the virus to enter host cells, and
 represents a promising target for antiviral drugs. A common therapeutic
 strategy involves deploying small molecules to inhibit the protein-protein
 interaction (PPI) between the RBD and the human angiotensin-converting
 enzyme 2 (ACE2) to which it binds. But unfortunately, it is difficult to
 inhibit such PPIs using small molecules due to the large interaction
 surface area involved. To overcome this difficulty, we propose to develop
 a novel antiviral strategy whereby small molecules will be used to
 specifically bind and stabilize intermediates in the RBD folding pathway,
 thus inhibiting the domain’s folding and promoting the S protein’s
 degradation. Using folding simulations, we plan to map the RBD’s folding
 pathway in atomistic detail and identify long-lived intermediates with
 well-defined binding pockets. We will then identify existing, as well as
 newly-designed small molecules that bind these cavities with high
 affinity, but do not bind the native state. The resulting hits will then
 be experimentally screened for their ability to inhibit RBD folding and
 their antiviral activity. If successful, this approach will yield a novel
 therapeutic strategy against SARS-CoV 2 that overcomes difficulties
 associated with most RBD inhibitors. Furthermore, we expect it will be
 difficult for SARS-CoV 2 to acquire resistance to these folding
 inhibitors, owing to severe fitness costs associated with mutating
 residues that are surface-exposed in folding intermediates."
