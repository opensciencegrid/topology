Description: Our project is to prove the non-existence of symplectic curves with specific
  numbers and types of cusps in the two dimensional complex projective plane. The
  method we are using involves writing the configuration of the blow-up of the curve
  in a certain reduced basis of the second homology group, and then eliminating these
  possibilities using further constraints. If we are successful this project could
  further elucidate the differences between the symplectic category and the category
  of algebraic geometry.
