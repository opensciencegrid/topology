Description: "Research within the lab focuses on evolutionary biology, molecular ecology, and population genetics. Broadly our interests fall into two categories: the evolutionary forces driving population differentiation and dynamics within mosaic landscapes, and the evolution and ecological significance of alternative reproductive strategies. We investigate these in a variety of systems, including mammals, reptiles, amphibians, and insects, and address them using high resolution molecular markers. Much of this work is in collaboration with other researchers, maximizing the resources and expertise available to a given question."
