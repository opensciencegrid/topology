Description: 'We are interested in understanding human semantic memory: our store
  of knowledge about the meanings of words, objects and events. Specifically, we would
  like to understand how semantic knowledge is represented and processed in the mind
  and brain, how it is acquired throughout development, how semantic tasks are performed
  by healthy adults and experts, and how various forms of brain damage can disrupt
  semantic knowledge. We address these questions using computer models, functional
  neuroimaging, and behavioral studies.'
