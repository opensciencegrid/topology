Description: Little is known about the evolutionary pathways enabling a protein to
  change its function to changing environmental needs, especially in regards to metabolism
  and toxicity. Evolution simulations that explicitly model the three-dimensional
  interaction of mutated proteins with their targets is a new approach that complements
  the ongoing explosion of directed evolution experiments. In this project, the evolutionary
  dynamics of a lattice representation of antibiotic resistance protein (beta lactamase)
  is studied by enhanced-sampling folding-binding simulations for an initial protein
  undergoing selection-dependent mutation to bind a new antibiotic. The goals of this
  work are to understand the fundamental physical bottlenecks and dynamical behavior
  of protein evolution. Important questions include the extent of dominant pathways
  (convergent evolution) and phase transitions in evolutionary rates (punctuated equilibrium).
  These principals and their structural underpinnings can also be used to inform rational
  design of antibiotics that exploit bottlenecks in pathogen mutational response.
