Description: "A framework for massively parallel climate impact simulations: the parallel\
  \ System for Integrating Impact Models and Sectors (pSIMS). This framework comprises\
  \ a) tools for ingesting and \nconverting large amounts of data to a versatile datatype\
  \ based on a common geospatial grid; b) tools for translating this datatype into\
  \ custom formats for site-based models; c) a scalable parallel framework for performing\
  \ large ensemble simulations, using any one of a number of different impacts models,\
  \ on clusters, supercomputers, distributed grids, or clouds; d) tools and data standards\
  \ for reformatting outputs to common datatypes for analysis and visualization; and\
  \ e) methodologies for aggregating these datatypes to arbitrary spatial scales such\
  \ as administrative and environmental demarcations. By automating many time-consuming\
  \ and error-prone aspects of large-scale climate impacts studies, pSIMS\naccelerates\
  \ computational research, encourages model intercomparison, and enhances reproducibility\
  \ of\nsimulation results."
