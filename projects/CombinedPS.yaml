Description: "Design and control of exoskeletons (and prostheses) thus far has been\
  \ primarily carried out following heuristic methods and exhaustive experimental\
  \ (design and test) procedures. This approach significantly slows down design iterations\
  \ and increases project costs. A predictive simulation framework for combined human\
  \ and device dynamics is a valuable tool that can significantly accelerate optimal\
  \ device and controller design. \n\nWe are building predictive models of combined\
  \ muscuoloskeletal and exoskeleton dynamics for walking, where design parameters\
  \ for the exoskeleton (such as actuation torque profiles) and various objective\
  \ functions (such as metabolic cost) can be optimized simultaneously."
