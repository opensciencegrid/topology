Description: Our research focuses on collider phenomenology, studying phenomena at
  the LHC and future colliders such as the FCC-ee, FCC-hh, and the muon collider.
  We aim to test the predictions of the Standard Model (SM) and search for potential
  new physics beyond the SM. To achieve this, we rely on Monte Carlo simulations to
  generate and analyze high-energy collision events, enabling us to explore both established
  theories and new physics scenarios.
