Description: We request computing time on Stampede to perform air shower simulations
  for the VERITAS air Cherenkov gamma-ray telescope. The new set replaces an existing
  5 year old set of shower simulations. Air shower simulations are essential to understand
  the instrument response of VERITAS and needed in the analysis of VERITAS data. The
  proposed new set of simulations will allow the VERITAS Collaboration to extend the
  usable energy range of the VERITAS instrument beyond 10 TeV and significantly reduce
  systematic uncertainties at all energies.
