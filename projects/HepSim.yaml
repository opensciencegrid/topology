Description: HepSim is a public repository with Monte Carlo simulations for particle-collision
  experiments. It contains predictions from leading-order (LO) parton shower models,
  next-to-leading order (NLO) and NLO with matched parton showers. It also includes
  Monte Carlo events after fast ("parametric") and full (Geant4) detector simulations
  and event reconstruction.
