  I will be using computer simulations to model the orbital evolution of comets and asteroids over the 
  lifetime of the solar system. In addition, I will be studying the stability of the solar system and Kuiper belt as
  it is subjected to close flybys of other stars in the Milky Way. https://www.psi.edu/about/staffpage/nkaib
