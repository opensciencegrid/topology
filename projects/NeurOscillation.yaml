Description: Our lab studies the rhythms of the brain, recorded electrically as oscillations
  in voltage. These brain rhythms have been hypothesized to underlie functional communication
  between different brain regions, but the mechanism by which it does this is not
  clear. Additionally, it is not clear from a biophysical standpoint how these oscillations
  are generated. Our lab studies both noninvasive and clinical recordings from human
  subjects and patients in order to better understand these rhythms of the brain.
  For example, the project contact's personal research investigates the variations
  in the waveform shape of neural oscillations. Why are some oscillations nonsinusoidal
  (e.g. sawtooth), how does this impact neural communication, and how does this relate
  to high-level behaviors?
