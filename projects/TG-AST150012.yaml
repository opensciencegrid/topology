Description: "We request a startup allocation to support development on two related\
  \ projects.  The main idea is to use three dimensional simulations to constrain\
  \ the histories of observed galaxies. The majority of work (1) during the initial\
  \ periods of this startup will be for Graduate Student S. Alireza Mortazavi to shift\
  \ an existing Condor-based pipeline at the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI)\
  \ to the Open Science Grid in order to test and plan for an ambitious expansion\
  \ of his research program to constrain the dynamical histories of galaxies (Mortazavi\
  \ et al. 2015). PI Snyder will also begin to develop pipelines to exploit large-scale\
  \ cosmological hydrodynamical simulations (2), which predict the evolution of entire\
  \ populations of galaxies in representative model universes, requiring data-intensive\
  \ computing.  \n\n1.  Modeling the Initial Conditions of Interacting Galaxy Pairs\
  \ Using Identikit\n\nWe use the Identikit software (Barnes & Hibbard 2009, Barnes\
  \ 2011; http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/~barnes/research/identikit/ ) to model the dynamics\
  \ of interacting galaxy pairs. By measuring the initial conditions of galaxy mergers,\
  \ we can constrain both cosmology and galaxy astrophysics. A galactic encounter\
  \ has several free parameters and it is time consuming to find the best match between\
  \ model and data. However, Identikit combines multiple techniques to quickly explore\
  \ parameter space to find the simulation most similar to the observed shape and\
  \ constituent velocities. We have developed an automated pipeline based on the latest\
  \ version of Identikit to scan parameter space and find robust matches and associated\
  \ uncertainties (Mortazavi et al. 2015), implemented in an STScI-based Condor environment.\
  \ We will continue to test our method against simulations of galaxy mergers to determine\
  \ the systematic errors in our measurements. In addition, we will apply it to real\
  \ data: We have observed a sample of ~30 interacting galaxy pairs using different\
  \ telescopes. We have reached the limits of the HTCondor cluster at STScI, and therefore\
  \ we seek to test the options available through XSEDE. We need around 50,000 SUs\
  \ to compute matches and uncertainties of the measurements for each merging pair\
  \ (observed or simulated), and so we are requesting a startup allocation of 150,000\
  \ SUs to perform tests while planning for a larger research allocation.  This research\
  \ will have direct applications for interpreting data from the Sloan Digital Sky\
  \ Survey-IV survey \"Mapping Nearby Galaxies at APO\" (MaNGA).\n\n2.  Mock data\
  \ applications from large hydrodynamical simulations\n\nPI Snyder will develop methods\
  \ for converting large cosmological simulations of galaxy formation (e.g., the Illustris\
  \ Project www.illustris-project.org) into direct predictions for astronomical observatories.\
  \  With XSEDE resources, I will seek to expand our Mock Galaxy Observatory efforts\
  \ in new and ambitious directions, such as creating synthetic survey fields and\
  \ advanced spectroscopic data products.  For instance, we will explore the possibility\
  \ of using large cosmological simulations as benchmarks for the Identikit modeling\
  \ described in project 1.  For testing, we are requesting 50,000 SUs on Gordon,\
  \ and Data Oasis storage of 5000GB, enough to store two Illustris Simulation (or\
  \ similar) outputs plus post-processed data products.  In future allocation requests,\
  \ we may seek to make these model archives available to the community through an\
  \ XSEDE Gateway."
