Description: To develop a contextual search technique on a given text corpus. The
  idea is to develop a search model using Deep Learning techniques and Natural Language
  Processing. More specifically, we are currently exploring Word Embedding techniques
  in NLP and Neural Network models like Word2Vec. The model would first train itself
  on the existing email corpus of a given user and then be able to provide search
  results based on contextual queries.
