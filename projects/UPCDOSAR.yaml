Description: 'Researchers from UNAL will be using OSG and running example jobs on
  Monte Carlo simulations, they will be submitting jobs related to bit patterned media,
  following this work http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386947715303222,
  and will also be submitting jobs related to research in critical phenomena, similar
  to what was done here: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304885316324933?via%3Dihub
