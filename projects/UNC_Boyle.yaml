Description: The goal of this project is to generate light curves from the TESS space
  telescope for every bright star (TESS magnitude < 16) within 500 pc of Earth. I
  will use these light curves to measure stellar rotation periods for as many of these
  stars as possible. By measuring stellar rotation periods, I can identify young stars
  close to Earth, find new groups of young stars, and create a list of young stars
  around which to search for planets.
