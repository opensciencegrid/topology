Description: The planned research will discover improved flows for thermal transport enhancement. We will extend an existing steady 2D method to efficiently compute optimal unsteady 2D flows in benchmark geometries such as channel flows, and closed and open domains between hot and cold surfaces. We will also develop computational methods for optimal flows in 3D domains that are analogous to the 2D domains we have studied, and determine the gains from 3D flows relative to 2D flows in comparable domains.
