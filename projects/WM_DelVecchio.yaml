Description: Project involves linking existing cyberinfrastructure to task of scalable
  and reproducible analysis of Arctic landscapes and climate data (https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2311319).
  Part of a "Pathways" project for the National Discovery Cloud for Climate with the
  goal of linking up existing projects and infrastructure to enhance science projects
  like mine. Goals of this collaboration include accessing satellite and climate data
  stored on lab servers/AWS, efficient/distributed computation on those datasets,
  and hosting some sort of cached version of those datasets for quick access and analysis.
