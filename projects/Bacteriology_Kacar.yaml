Description: "Our research focuses on reconstructing molecular time machines to explore\
  \ and attempt to rebuild lost histories. We use tools drawn from synthetic biology,\
  \ molecular biology and evolutionary biology to tackle challenging questions in\
  \ life sciences that will allow us to understand life\u2019s fundamental innovations.\
  \ We hope to reveal underlying molecular mechanisms that are directly and indirectly\
  \ responsible for maintaining conditions of habitability on our planet\u2019s surface."
