Description: How large a role does history play in evolution? Do later events depend
  critically on specific earlier events, or do all events occur more or less independently?
  If a change occurs early in evolution, does it become easier or harder to revert
  the change as time proceeds? We intend to explore these ideas in the context of
  protein evolution, by simulating sequence evolution under purifying selection and
  then systematically permuting the order of amino-acid substitutions.
