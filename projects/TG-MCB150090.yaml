Description: Solvation strongly affects the structures and properties of molecules.  Molecular
  simulations for many problems in chemistry, physics, and biology require an accurate
  depiction of solvation, and the most ubiquitous and important solvent is water.  Yet,
  water is difficult to model in molecular simulations - fast but sometimes erroneous
  modeling can be done with continuum solvent models, or relatively accurate but expensive
  modeling can be done explicitly.  Users must generally compromise accuracy and efficiency
  for the problem of interest.  Though widespread efforts are directed at testing
  water models, much of this work is duplicative and incomplete.  Here we propose
  extensive computer simulations of biomolecular solvation using XSEDE.  These simulations
  will provide a systematic database of solvation free energies for a large and diverse
  set of biomolecules and conformations.  This database will extend our understanding
  of molecular solvation and will provide a communal resource for the development
  of continuum solvent models, a focus of many groups throughout the field.
