Description: XSEDE resources will be used to generate several trillion simulated collision
  events for the CERN Large Hadron Collider Experiment.  The simulated events will
  be generated by the Monte Carlo simulation program called Herwig 7 (herwig.hepforge.org)
  interfaced with the module HJets++ (hjets.hepforge.org). The primary focus will
  the simulation of the scattering of two protons into a Higgs boson is association
  with jets (H+3 Jets). Jets are are clusters of energetic hadrons. Hadrons are composite
  particles that are comprised of fundamental particles called quarks and gluons.  Results
  for the next-to-next leading order QCD corrections of H+3 Jets have been published
  in Physical Review Letters (http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.111.211802).  However,
  further simulations are required to evaluate the theoretical uncertainties for the
  integrated scattering cross-section and kinematics distributions for H+3 Jets.  In
  order to evaluate the scattering cross-section with a Monte Carlo integration error
  of 1 per mille, it is necessary to simulate at least a trillion weighted events.  The
  parallel computing computing environment that XSEDE provides will provide the necessary
  events to achieve lower integration errors.
