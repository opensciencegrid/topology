Description: 'Simulate hundreds of millions of high-energy

  proton proton collisions, which mimic the

  collisions expected at the LHC in the coming

  years.  This simulated data is used to assess the

  physics potential of potential detector upgrades,

  allowing decision makers and funding agencies to

  plan for the future.'
