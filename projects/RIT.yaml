Description: Ramsey theory studies the properties that combinatorial structures need
  in order to guarantee that desired substructures are contained within them. It is
  often seen as the study of the order that comes from randomness, and has applications
  in mathematics, computer science, finance, economics, and other areas. Our research
  involves a computational approach to establishing the values of various Ramsey numbers,
  whose role is to quantify the general existential theorems in Ramsey theory.
