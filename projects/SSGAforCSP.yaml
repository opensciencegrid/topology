Description: This project will use the OSG to demonstrate the feasibility of using
  a new steady state genetic algorithm (SSGA), recently introduced by the MGAC collaboration,
  to predict the crystal structures of molecules of pharmaceutical interest. The OSG
  resources are ideal for this project because the SSGA requires a large number of
  independent energy calculations of candidate structures. These calculations for
  simple molecules will use the DFT approach, using software already available in
  the OSG.
