Description: We aim to perform large-scale simulations of error-correcting codes for
  quantum computation. In particular, we wish to test post-selection strategies for
  high-rate quantum codes (those that very efficiently pack in a large amount of error-corrected
  qubits into a relatively small number of physical qubits) which will allow us to
  improve the error rate by orders of magnitude by only rejecting a small fraction
  of the shots. Our work is highly suitable for high throughput computing because
  we need to take billions of shots of the simulation, each of which is very cheap;
  it is not a problem if our jobs are cancelled.
