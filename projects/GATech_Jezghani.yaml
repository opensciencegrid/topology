Description: Free neutron and nuclear isotope beta decay is a sensitive test of the Standard Model and probe for BSM physics that complements high-energy efforts such as those at the LHC. Precision efforts such as the Nab experiment at ORNL rely on high-statistics simulations to constrain error. More details can be seen at https://nab.phys.virginia.edu.
