Description: Molecular-level information of DNA at nanometer length scales is of fundamental
  interest to many aspects of nanotechnology and biology. Molecular models provide
  a powerful tool to interrogate these systems by providing detailed thermodynamic
  and kinetic information. Towards this end, this project involves developing highly-accurate
  coarse-grained models of DNA and using them to study complex nano-scale phenomena.
