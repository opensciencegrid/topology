Description: Our research focuses on understanding the dynamics of mitonuclear co-evolution
  in populations of microorganisms. We use experimental evolution, next-generation
  sequencing, and systems biology approaches to study how populations adapt to different
  pairs of nuclear and mitochondrial genomes to uncover the mechanisms underlying
  these processes.
