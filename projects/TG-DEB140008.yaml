Description: We propose to test community level population genetic patterns of coral
  reef fishes as they pertain to the Depth Refuge Hypothesis (DRH) of coral reefs
  by applying a statistical framework for multi-species analyses using hierarchical
  Approximate Bayesian Computation (hABC). The DRH specifies that deep reefs are protected
  from disturbances that effect shallow habitat and can provide a viable reproductive
  source for shallow reef areas following disturbance. It has been proposed that these
  foundation reefs may provide refuge not only from local disturbances such as storms
  or pollution, but can act as a refuge for geographically broad scale major disturbances
  such as the glaceoeustatic sea-level fluctuations that occur on the order of approximately
  100k years at an amplitude of over 100m. During the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) sea
  level was thought to have reduced shallow habitat by as much as 90% in the tropical
  Pacific possibly resulting in increased habitat fragmentation, local extinction,
  or bottlenecks. We will combine multi-taxa population genetic datasets into a single
  analysis to determine the proportion of the current community that historically
  expanded in a temporally clustered pulse, when the pulse occurred, and in what direction
  (i.e. from shallow water to shallow water across locations, deep water to adjacent
  shallow water, from shallow water to adjacent deep water, or deep water to deep
  water across locations.) across the Hawaiian archipelago.
