Description: The XENON Dark Matter Experiment located at the Gran Sasso Laboratories
  (INFN, Italy), is currently the leader world project searching for the so called
  Dark Matter, something which is completely different from ordinary matter. This
  Dark Matter is not (as the name hints) visible, but it should pervade the entire
  Universe. Its presence has been confirmed by different experimental evidences, however
  its intrinsic nature is one of the big puzzle of Modern Physics. The XENON Experiment
  could reveal the nature of the DM looking at the possible interactions of the DM
  with ordinary matter, for instance with the Xenon, a noble gas been liquified at
  very low temperature. The study of the background signal, from the environment and
  from the materials that make up the new detector containing the Xenon, is essential
  to understand the detector's behavior and its implications on its performances.
