Description: SNO+ is a multi-purpose liquid scintillator detector with a primary goal
  of studying neutrino-less double beta decay in Tellurium-130, and is also capable
  of measurements involving solar neutrinos, reactor antineutrinos and geoneutrinos,
  supernovae, certain nucleon decay modes. Data collected by the detector are moved
  to (UK and Canadian) grid storage, where automated processing occurs. The large
  number of simulated data sets required for statistical analyses are also produced
  on grid resources. The total combined size of the data and simulations is expected
  to be on the order of 100 TB, which makes transfer, storage, and processing (i.e.
  running custom ROOT code) intractable on local resources available at collaborating
  US institutions. Hence, access to grid storage and processing is imperative for
  the analysis of the SNO+ data by US Collaborators.
