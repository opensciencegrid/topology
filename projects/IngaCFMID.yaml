Description: We study how interactions between plants and their insect herbivores
  lead to the evolution of plant defenses, including plant's chemical defenses. In
  order to identify some of the many unknown compounds we have isolated via LC-MS
  from the tropical tree genus Inga (Fabaceae), we use in silico fragmentation to
  predict the ms/ms spectra for a given chemical structure using Competitive Fragmentation
  Modeling for Metabolite Identification (CFM-ID) (http://cfmid.wishartlab.com). This
  allows us to match observed ms/ms spectra with a theoretical library of known and
  predicted chemical structures.
