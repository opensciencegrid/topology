Department: Chemistry
Description: The project involves studies of substrate binding, electron and proton
  transport pathways and substrate release in enzymes that can catalyze the synthesis
  of fuels in photoelectrochemical cells. The insights obtained will guide the design
  of small molecule electrocatalysts in collaboration with experimentalists.
