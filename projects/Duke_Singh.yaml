Description: 'Understanding the kinetics of drug-target interactions is important
  for designing therapeutics with desirable pharmacological profiles. Current experimental
  and simulation methods for studying ligand residence time are expensive and low-throughput.
  We seek to model ligand residence time for numerous systems using molecular dynamics
  simulations and distill this information into a machine learning predictive model
  that can be applied to high-throughput screening and optimization. Lab website:  https://singhlab.net/.'
