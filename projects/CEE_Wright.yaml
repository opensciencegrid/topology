Description: 'Our research team works in a number of research areas with the field
  of computational hydrometeorology and hydroclimatology:

  * Measurement, modeling, and analysis of extreme rainfall at high resolution using
  a variety of sources including rain gages, ground-based weather radar, satellite-based
  sensors, and numerical weather and climate models.

  * Understanding the roles of rainfall and land surface process variability and interactions
  to produce floods at a wide range of scales using high-resolution multi-scale supercomputer-based
  watershed models.

  * Interfacing with meteorologists and climate scientists to translate projected
  changes in extreme precipitation from regional and global climate models into projections
  of future risks.

  * Developing practical tools for improved probabilistic rainfall and flood hazard
  and risk estimation.'
