Description: With the emergence of massively parallel sequencing, genome-wide expression
  data production has reached an unprecedented level. This abundance of data has greatly
  facilitated maize research, but may not be amenable to traditional analysis techniques
  that were optimized for other data types. Using publicly available data, a Gene
  Co-expression Network (GCN) can be constructed and used for gene function prediction,
  candidate gene selection and improving understanding of regulatory pathways. Several
  GCN studies have been done in maize, mostly using microarray datasets. To build
  an optimal GCN from plant materials RNA-Seq data, parameters for expression data
  normalization and network inference were evaluated. We previously constructed an
  optimized gene coexpression network for maize. In this project, we want to build
  gene regulatory networks for Arabidopsis, rice maize, and sorghum.
