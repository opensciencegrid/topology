Description: The Bioinformatics Core Research Facility at UNL runs several large scale
  compute projects a year. Our main compute is focused on sequence analysis, de-novo
  assembly and gene prediction/annotation, secondary structure prediction, peptide-protein
  docking, and phenotype image analysis. We tend to run projects that deal with species
  critical for agriculture, both crops and livestock, but also with human-virus or
  food-gut microbiome interactions.
