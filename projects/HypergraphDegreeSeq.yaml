Description: A degree sequence of a hypergraph is a list of numbers that gives the
  total number of edges each vertex is in and multiple hypergraphs can have the same
  degree sequence.  I'm trying to determine a minimal set of moves that connects all
  of the realizations.  I need to use parallel programming as there are many degree
  sequences to investigate.
