Department: Geography and Geographic Information Science
Description: Geographic Information Science (GIScience), crosscutting many fields
  (e.g., geography, social sciences, computer science, geodesy, and information sciences),
  plays essential roles for transforming geographic data into geospatial information
  and knowledge, breaking through scientific problems, and improving decision-making
  practices of broad and significant societal impact. However, fulfilling such roles
  is increasingly dependent on the ability to handle very large spatial datasets and
  complex analysis and modeling methods based on synthesizing computational and spatial
  thinking enabled by cyberinfrastructure (CI), which conventional GIS software approaches
  do not provide. CI-based integration of geographic information systems (GIS) and
  spatial analysis and modeling, as a holistic solution, is leading to unprecedented
  capabilities for transforming geospatial sciences.The purpose of this project is
  to extend and sustain GISolve, a TeraGrid Science Gateway toolkit for GIScience,
  for establishing a high performance, distributed, and collaborative CyberGIS framework
  that couples CI, GIS, and geospatial analysis and modeling capabilities. Through
  the continuous TeraGrid resource allocation support from previous three years, a
  set of spatial middleware components has been built into the GISolve Toolkit to
  glue generic cyberinfrastructure capabilities and geospatial analysis methods. This
  toolkit has been used to build the TeraGrid GIScience Gateway as a collaborative
  geospatial problem-solving environment for multi-disciplinary researchers to perform
  large-scale geospatial analysis and modeling, and help non-technical users directly
  benefit from accessing TeraGrid capabilities. With the support of TeraGrid high-end
  computing resources, we have developed a set of high-performance parallel and distributed
  geospatial computational methods for our research projects. Scalability and efficient
  use of high-end computing resources are the foci in developing these methods. For
  example, the parallel agent-based modeling and parallel land use optimization code
  are scalable to thousands of processors on Abe and Ranger with impressive computational
  performance. The methods so developed have been applied in solving large- and multi-scale
  geospatial science problems that could not be solved before, such as the study of
  geospatial pattern of the impact of global climate change on crop yields. With GISolve
  being widely used in the GIScience community, new methods continue to be identified,
  proposed, and integrated in the GISolve Toolkit. To support community-contributed
  applications, we have developed a streamlined application integration process to
  facilitate cyberinfrastructure-enabled computation and efficient integration into
  the science gateway for sharing. This project has been growing dramatically with
  consistent and extended research collaboration and education efforts such as the
  collaboration with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in the National Map project
  and outreach activities with the University Consortium for Geographic Information
  Science (UCGIS).
