Description: We investigate how synchronous population activity arise in spiking dynamics
  of the sensory and other cortical areas. We especially focus on how primary auditory
  cortex modulate dynamical timescales during spontaneous bump dynamics in quiet wake
  condition and up and down states in anesthetized and sleep conditions.
