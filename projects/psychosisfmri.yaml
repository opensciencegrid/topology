Description: This project will make use of fMRI data of psychotic patients in order
  to parse heterogeneity in functional activity across multiple diagnosis. The need
  for computing power results from the need to preprocess the fMRI, from which we
  want to obtain a region level connectivity matrix for each of the approximately
  1200 subjects that will be analyzed.
