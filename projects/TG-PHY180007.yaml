Description: The Jet Energy-loss Tomography with a Statistically and
  Computationally Advanced Program Envelope (JETSCAPE) collaboration
  is an NSF funded SSI-collaboration of 6 institutions.The JETSCAPE
  Collaboration is tasked with the design and construction of a
  software framework that can be used to simulate collisions of large
  nuclei at extreme energies, to populate the framework with
  interacting modules that simulate different aspects of the
  collision, and use Bayesian techniques to make statistical comparisons
  between the results of this event generator and experimental data.
  Nuclear collision experiments at Brookhaven National Lab. and at
  CERN produce a state of matter called the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP),
  which exists only above 2 trillion degrees. The QGP lives for about
  10 septillionths of a second, before cooling down and explosively
  evaporating to a spray of conventional matter. The separate modules
  of the JETSCAPE event generator will simulate the initial state of
  the colliding nuclei, the pre-equilibrium dynamics, the viscous fluid
  dynamical expansion where the QGP cools down to an interacting state
  of conventional matter, and the final evaporation of the droplet into
  a spray of conventional particles. The framework and developed event
  generator places special emphasis on the simulation of extremely high
  energy jets that are produced in rarer events, traverse the dense QGP
  and are modified on exit. The study of this modification in comparison
  with jets in vacuum yields clues to the internal structure of the QGP.
  Before such simulations can be carried out, the different interacting
  modules of the event generator have to be tuned (unknown parameters
  set) by comparison with a small subset of available experimental data.
  We are requesting allocation time on the OSG to start the tuning of a
  scaled down version of the full event generator. The startup allocation
  will allow us to estimate both the time required for the tuning and
  simulations of the default event generator.
