Description: Methods that integrate population sampling from multiple taxa into a
  single analysis are a much needed addition to the comparative phylogeographic toolkit.  Here
  we present a statistical framework for multi-species analysis based on hierarchical
  approximate Bayesian computation (hABC) for inferring community dynamics and concerted
  demographic response.  Detecting community response to climate change is an important
  issue with regards to how species have and will react to past and future events.  Furthermore,
  whether species responded individualistically or in concert is at the center of
  related questions about the abiotic and biotic determinants of community assembly.  This
  method combines multi-taxon genetic datasets into a single analysis to determine
  the proportion of a contemporary community that historically expanded in a temporally
  clustered pulse as well as when the pulse occurred.  We will apply this method to
  59 species in the Hawaiian Archipelago in order to examine community response of
  coral reef taxa to sea-level change in Hawaii.  The method can accommodate dataset
  heterogeneity such as variability in effective population size, mutation rates,
  and sample sizes across species and utilizes borrowing strength from the simultaneous
  analysis of multiple species.  This hABC framework used in a multi-taxa demographic
  context can increase our understanding of the impact of historical climate change
  by determining what proportion of the community responded in concert or independently,
  and can be used with a wide variety of comparative phylogeographic datasets as biota-wide
  DNA barcoding data sets accumulate.
