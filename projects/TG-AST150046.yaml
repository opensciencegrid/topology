Description: We are using several large codes to search the photometric database from
  the Kepler satellite for stars that exhibit flares and starspots, to characterize
  the flare and starspot behavior and to extract information on starspot locations
  and properties using transiting planets as probes of stellar surface brightness
  variations.  The XSEDE resources will enable this project to proceed much more quickly
  than with the resources at our home institutions.
