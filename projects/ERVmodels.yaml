Description: "Project Description: Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are viewed as ancient\
  \ retroviral infections in vertebrate genomes and are commonly referred to as viral\
  \ fossils, accounting for approximately 8% of the human genome. In order to increase\
  \ our understanding of these viruses in host genomes, I am developing more complex\
  \ models that describe the evolution of ERVs in host genomes. Specifically, I am\
  \ interested in understanding evolutionary patterns of ERVs that have intact genes\
  \ and are theoretically able to re-infect when \ncompared to those that lost this\
  \ ability."
