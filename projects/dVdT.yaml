Description: "The main goal of the project is to design a computational framework\
  \ that enables computational experimentation at scale while supporting the model\
  \ of \u201Csubmit locally, compute globally\u201D. The project focuses on estimating\
  \ application resource needs, finding the appropriate computing resources, acquiring\
  \ those resources, deploying the applications and data on the resources, managing\
  \ applications and resources during run. The project also aims to advance the understanding\
  \ of resource management within a collaboration in the areas of: trust, planning\
  \ for resource provisioning, and workload, computer, data, and network resource\
  \ management."
