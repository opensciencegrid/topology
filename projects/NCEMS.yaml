Description: 'The National Synthesis Center for Emergence in the Molecular and Cellular
  Sciences (NCEMS), funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF), is dedicated
  to catalyzing multidisciplinary scientific teams to synthesize publicly available
  data to address fundamental questions related to emergence phenomena in the molecular
  and cellular biosciences. NCEMS efforts are focused on emergent properties at the
  mesoscale. A description of our first cohort of 10 Working Groups is available here:
