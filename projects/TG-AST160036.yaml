Description: Starspots are dark regions on a star's surface that trace areas of strong
  magnetic fields. On the Sun, spots are typically small and occur in bands near the
  stellar equator. Sunspot occurrence frequency also peaks every 11 years due to the
  "solar cycle". For younger stars there are indications that spots are larger, and
  can form near the stellar poles, while evidence for spot activity cycles on other
  stars is sparse. These differences indicate that the shape and strength of the internal
  magnetic dynamo evolves throughout a stars life. However, because of their great
  distance we cannot directly observe the surface of other stars to map the locations
  and sizes of spots. We have developed new software to model the signature of starspots
  in Kepler data from transiting exoplanet systems. These star-planet systems are
  unique in having an orbiting planet that passes directly in front of its parent
  star. When the planet transits the star, it will briefly pass over spots on the
  star's surface, giving a very small change in the apparent brightness of the system.
  To trace the evolution of spot size and location with stellar age we must extend
  our analysis to many star systems with different transiting planet orientations.
  A startup allocation from XSEDE will allow us to test our software's ability to
  map spots from different system orientations, and using many years worth of Kepler
  data.
