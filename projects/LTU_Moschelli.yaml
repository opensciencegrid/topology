Description: Simulations of relativistic nuclear collisions. These simulations produce
  an "initial state" intended to mimic the moment of the nuclear collision and then
  several stages describing the dynamics of the interactions of the matter produced
  in the collision until the point until where it would be seen by experimental detectors.
  The goal of these simulations is to investigate theories of the strong nuclear force
  that governs the production of the initial state and interactions of produced matter.
