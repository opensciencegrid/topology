Description: The goal of this research is to develop a computational tool that can
  uncover the pathway and the transition states that exist when a molecule changes
  conformation or when it chemically changes. In many such circumstances, a process
  must overcome an energy barrier before proceeding to completion. If the size of
  the barrier is large compared to the available thermal energy, a process must rely
  on the occurrence of one or more rare events. For such circumstances, one would
  like to understand the reaction pathways so as to improve yields, or as in the case
  of protein folding, to understand the intermediate states. Many simple processes
  have been explored using theoretical tools such as molecular dynamics, where the
  movements of individual atoms are calculated. However, when the barrier is large,
  crossing the relevant barrier is indeed a very rare event. Although computer speeds
  have been doubling every 18 months (a consequence of Moore's law), the exponentially
  long waiting times necessary for barrier hopping pushes the required computational
  effort out of the feasibility range for all but the simplest models. To explore
  these barrier-limited processes, we are developing a novel computational technique
  to sample the paths themselves in a thermodynamically significant manner.
