Description: "Project Description: Our research is primarily focused on the transmission\
  \ and evolution of two zoonotic pathogens, enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC)\
  \ and Salmonella. These pathogens reside in the intestinal tracts of animal hosts\
  \ where they encounter diverse microbial communities, fluctuating nutrient levels,\
  \ and myriad host factors. Transmission between hosts requires these pathogens to\
  \ survive varied environmental conditions. The general stress protection system\
  \ (regulated by the alternative sigma factor, \u03C3s) is known to play a central\
  \ role in environmental persistence and transmission. Acid and desiccation tolerance\
  \ are two transmission-associated phenotypes that are dependent upon \u03C3s \u2013\
  regulated genes. We are also investigating the role of prophage in fitness. EHEC\
  \ harbor multiple lambda-like prophage and cryptic phage remnants in their genome\
  \ that facilitate genomic rearrangements, gene duplications, and deletions by homologous\
  \ recombination. \nWe are investigating how these phage-mediated genomic rearrangements\
  \ influence the persistence of EHEC in its bovine host and the environment. The\
  \ goals of our research are to use results from these fundamental studies in the\
  \ development of strategies to reduce pathogen transmission."
