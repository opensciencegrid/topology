Description: The amino acid content in maize kernels is critically important for human
  and animal nutrition. However, the genetic basis underpinning amino acids is not
  fully understood. We are performing Genome Wide Association Studies and Genomic
  prediction in a panel of several thousand maize plants genotyped at tens of millions
  of loci to finely dissect amino acid traits in maize.
