Description: "Organic mixed ionic\u2013electronic conductors (OMIECs) couple \u03C0\
  -conjugated electronic pathways with ion transport. The process of ion insertion-deinsertion,\
  \ which confers functionality, also produces pronounced electrochemical hysteresis,\
  \ resulting in time-dependent shifts in the current-voltage response. My research\
  \ is mainly about multi-scale simulation of organic mixed ionic-electronic conductors,\
  \ especially focusing on the mechanism of electrochemical hysteresis by molecular\
  \ dynamics simulations."
