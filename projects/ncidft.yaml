Description: 'Project Description: Density-Functional Theory (DFT) is the most successful
  method for the computation of quantum mechanical properties in molecules and solids.
  The aim of our project is to advance the DFT field by extending and improving the
  existing methods for modeling non-covalent interactions. Computational tasks for
  this project include DFT calculations on small molecules as well as periodic solids,
  and the use of home-made programs that implement our methodologies.'
