Description: Sage AI@Edge provides an image search service that requires a high throughput
  computing backend to process millions to trillions of images through an AI-driven
  workflow. The compute backend requires GPUs and a low latency processes that scales
  for the number of images produce and hosted by Sage. More information at https://sagecontinuum.org/
