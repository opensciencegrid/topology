Description: 'Project Description: Over the past five years, there has been a boom
  in technology startups that continues to attract more and more talent. While everyone
  starts with a million-dollar idea, only a few manage to transfer into real innovations
  and impact our lives. What makes those ideas successful? Can you imagine an app
  that tells you how innovative your idea is? This project will take a computational
  approach to the understanding of innovation and develop a machinery to learn from
  real data to evaluate the creativity of new ideas.

  Innovation is a broad topic, constantly discussed in business, economics, sociology,
  etc. It is such a complex phenomenon that there is no thorough theory about it.
  Here we will take a combinatorial perspective: an idea is a combination of existing
  and new knowledge. Hence, the goal is to understand why certain combinations are
  more interesting than others. Specifically, the first step is to map out our idea
  space with data from kickstarter, US Patents, and possibly other knowledge databases.
  The second step is to find interesting patterns, associations and dynamics in this
  map of knowledge. And finally computational methods will be developed to evaluate
  the fitness of any idea in a given environment.'
