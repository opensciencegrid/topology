Description: Analysis of geospatial imagery has become a promising approach for characterizing
  Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) proliferation. The goal of this project is to
  design algorithms and computer executable that can extract man-made objects (e.g.,
  building, road, gate, etc.) from high-resolution images (recording the boundary
  and location, and possible type).
