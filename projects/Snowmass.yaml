Description: 'Simulate hundreds of millions of high-energy

  proton proton collisions, which mimic the

  collisions expected at future hadron colliders.

  This simulated data is used to assess the physics

  potential of future colliders, allowing US

  decision makers and funding agencies to prioritize

  future physics projects.'
