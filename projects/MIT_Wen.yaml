Description: Running Quantum Monte Carlo simulations on quantum Hall states and its
  modifications which can lead to a superconductor, and compare its energetics to
  Fermi liquid states. See 2409.18067 and 2507.18582 for our recent efforts. We are
  trying to expand our calculation to Wigner crystal states and further class of Slater-Jastrow
  type wavefunctions to calculate a more exact wavefunction of parton theory which
  could lead to new insights in high Tc superconductivity or spin liquids.
