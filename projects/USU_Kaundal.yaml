Description: >-
  Biological data is accumulating faster than people’s capacity to
  analyze them. Our research interests and goals revolve around
  mitigating this issue in the context of “information to inference”
  scope. At USU, Dr. Kaundal has developed an independent and
  collaborative research program in bioinformatics, primarily focusing
  on computational mining of large multi-dimensional -omics datasets,
  and computational modeling using supervised (Machine Learning) and
  unsupervised (Bayesian-based) learning. Our group is actively
  developing novel tools and software to apply the gained knowledge
  towards organismal improvement. Research in KAABiL laboratory
  generally falls under the following major program objectives:
