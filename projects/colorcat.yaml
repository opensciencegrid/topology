Description: Different languages divide the visible light spectrum into words (e.g.
  "red," "green," "blue" ... in English) in different ways. However, despite the apparent
  freedom in assigning colors to different categories, there are clear universal patterns
  across languages in how they divide color space according to the number of color
  terms in the language. This pattern has now been empirically well established, however
  there remains a confusion of theories for why this pattern should exist at all.
  In fact, a simple, evolutionary model in tandem with a model of perceptual color
  space and color saliency, completely accounts for the observed universal patterns.
  We will use the open science grid to explore the parameter space of this model via
  many parallel, independent runs of the dynamics to find the best fit parameter values
  to the language data available.
