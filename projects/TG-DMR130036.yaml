Description: 'We request high throughput computing resources to perform diagrammatic
  Monte Carlo calculations of strongly correlated non-equilibrium electron systems.
  The calculations employ existing implementations of real-time quantum Monte Carlo
  algorithms for the solution of quantum impurity models, which have been tested and
  benchmarked; they also involve extensions to these algorithms which are currently
  under development. We will use these codes to address two types of physics problems:
  strongly correlated lattice systems treated within the dynamical mean field approximation,
  and exact properties of model systems for mesoscopic and molecular electronic junctions.'
