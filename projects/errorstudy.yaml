Description: "Missing data and genotyping errors are common features of microsatellite\
  \ data sets used to infer the genetic structure of natural populations.  We used\
  \ simulated data to quantify the effect of these data aberrations on the accuracy\
  \ of population structure inference.  Data sets were simulated under the coalescent\
  \ and ranged from panmictic to highly subdivided with complex, randomly generated,\
  \ population histories.  Models describing the characteristic patterns of missing\
  \ data and genotyping error in real microsatellite data sets were developed, and\
  \ used to modify the simulated data sets.  Performance of an ordination, a tree\
  \ based, and a model based Bayesian method of population structure inference was\
  \ evaluated before and after data set modifications.  The ability to recover correct\
  \ population clusters decreased as missing data increased.  The rate of decrease\
  \ was similar among analytical procedures, thus no single analytical approach was\
  \ preferable when\n faced with incomplete data.  Researchers should expect to retrieve\
  \ 3\u20134% fewer correct clusters for every 1% of a data matrix made up of missing\
  \ data using these methods.  For every 1% of a matrix that contained erroneous genotypes,\
  \ approximately 1\u20132% fewer correct clusters were recovered using ordination\
  \ and tree based methods.  A Bayesian procedure that minimizes the deviation from\
  \ Hardy Weinberg equilibrium in order to assign individuals to clusters performed\
  \ better as genotyping error increased.  We attribute this surprising result to\
  \ the inbreeding like nature of microsatellite genotyping error, and recommend the\
  \ use of related analytical methods that explicitly account for inbreeding, as a\
  \ means to mitigate the effect of genotyping error."
