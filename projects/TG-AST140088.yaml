Description: "The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is responsible for providing the IceCube\
  \ collaboration with Monte Carlo data including cosmic-ray shower simulations and\
  \ simulation of the IceCube detector response. These simulations are used for studying\
  \ the systematics of our detector and performance of future geometries. In addition,\
  \ a large volume of background cosmic ray simulation is needed in order to optimize\
  \ data analyses.\nA key component of simulating the IceCube detector is the correct\
  \ modeling of the optical properties of the Antarctic ice which requires a lot of\
  \ computation and has been adapted to run on GPUs.  \n\nThe IceProd framework is\
  \ a software package developed for IceCube with the goal of managing productions\
  \ across distributed systems and pooling together isolated computing resources that\
  \ are scattered throughout the Collaboration. It consists of a central database\
  \ hosted at University of Wisconsin-Madison and a set of daemons that are responsible\
  \ for management of grid jobs as and data handling through the use of existing grid\
  \ technology and network protocols. The IceCube Monte Carlo production is configured\
  \ as a distributed workflow DAG that utilizes both CPU and GPU resources for various\
  \ portions of the simulation chain. The intent is to utilize the Keeneland cluster\
  \ in Georgia Tech to run GPU tasks and OSG for general CPU tasks through XSEDE.\
  \ Intermediate files can be stored on a GridFTP server and are typically kept until\
  \ the individual DAG completes.  For a large production run, a typical storage requirement\
  \ might be on the order of 5 TB.\nThe IceCube collaboration would like to request\
  \ an initial allocation of 100,000 SU\u2019s. This allocation will be used to produce\
  \ and reconstruct Monte Carlo simulations for the IC86 in-ice detectors as well\
  \ as the IT81 surface detector."
