Description: The goal of the project is to develop fast, accurate algorithms for simulation
  and inference of stochastic differential equations (SDE).  Many SDE models of interest
  in science feature drift and diffusion coefficients with superlinear growth, which
  causes convergence and stability problems for many time integrators.  We seek improved
  methods that can overcome these problems, with a focus on correctly computing moments
  and densities of the solution.
