Description: 'The hope for magnetoencephalographic (MEG) measurements has been to
  produce functional brain mapping with high spatial (mm) and temporal (msec) resolution.
  Realizing this hope requires answers to these questions: (1) How many sources are
  active within the brain? (2) Where are they located. (3) What is their time course?
  MEG Virtual Recording (MVR) provides these while producing noninvasive measures
  of intracranial neuroelectric currents as if from 2,000,000+ directly implanted
  electrodes. It does so from single trial (unaveraged) data, has no free parameters,
  and provides very strong probabilistic measures to validate the existence of each
  identified source. We have demonstrated efficient implementation of MVR on the Open
  Sciences Grid. The measured computational load of 400 SU per second of MEG data
  makes supercomputing essential to practical implementation of MVR. We anticipate
  that MVR will enable identification of specific neurophysiological biomarkers of
  a variety of non-structural brain pathologies which have been refractory to date,
  e.g. concussion, post-traumatic stress disorder.'
