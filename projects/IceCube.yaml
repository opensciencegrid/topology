Description: 'IceCube is the world''s largest neutrino detector. It is located at
  the South Pole and  includes a cubic kilometer

  of instrumented ice.  IceCube searches for neutrinos from the most violent astrophysical
  sources: events like exploding stars, gamma

  ray bursts, and cataclysmic phenomena involving black holes and neutron stars. The
  IceCube telescope is a powerful tool to search for

  dark matter, and could reveal the new physical processes associated with the enigmatic
  origin of the highest energy particles in

  nature. In addition, exploring the background of neutrinos produced in the atmosphere,
  IceCube studies the neutrinos themselves; their

  energies far exceed those produced by accelerator beams.'
