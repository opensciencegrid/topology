Department: Plant and Agroecosystem Sciences
Description: The research program focuses on genetic and molecular understanding of
  agronomically relevant traits in cereal crops, especially maize, sorghum, and wheat.
  Current research interests in the lab include projects aimed at enhancing molecular
  understanding of variants influencing plant architecture, development, immunity,
  and their interactions. Uses Mendelian genetics, population genetics, molecular
  biology, and omics tools to explore a range of plant phenotypes.
