Description: 'The Stanic lab is focused on deciphering the role of Innate Lymphoid
  cells and immune cellular networks in the architectural organization of the maternal/fetal
  interface.


  His research program is dedicated to unravelling the cellular networks underlying
  preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction, recurrent pregnancy loss and implantation
  failure in Assisted Reproductive Technologies. Our lab employs both human and mouse
  models of reproductive physiology and disease. We use genetic targeting of immune
  cell development and function to dissect their role in reproductive tissue organization
  and disease. We collaborate closely with biostatisticians and computer scientists
  to develop novel workflows for analysis of our high-dimensional flow cytometry data
  sets and model the reproductive immune cell networks.'
