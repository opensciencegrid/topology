Description: The Beryllium Electron capture in Superconducting Tunnel
  junctions Experiment (BEeST) employs the decay–momentum reconstruction
  technique to precisely measure the 7Be 7Li recoil energy spectrum in
  superconducting tunnel junctions (STJs). This approach is a powerful,
  model-independent method in the search for beyond SM scenarios since
  it relies only on the existence of a heavy neutrino admixture to the
  active neutrinos.
