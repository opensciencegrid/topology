Description: 'Description: This proposal requests 20,000 SUs on XSEDE for 20 undergraduate
  students and mentors participating in the Computational Astronomy & Physics REU
  Program at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill in summer 2014. The time
  is needed for a computational methods tutorial on the Open Science Grid followed
  by optional use of the OSG for the students summer research projects, with possible
  continuing use through January 2014 to enable polishing the projects for presentation
  at conferences. The projects cover a range of topics in computational astronomy
  and physics. Details can be found in the supporting material attached.'
