Description: One of the biggest challenges facing the US healthcare
 system in caring for patients with COVID-19 is the limited number
 of ICU beds and ventilators available, in addition to concerns
 regarding staffing levels. Hospital cooperation can allow for
 patient transfers increasing the efficiency of the overall system
 and the number of patients who can receive treatment. We use data
 from COVID-19 in Maryland to formulate a mathematical model which
 can determine which hospitals are the best candidates for the
 patient transfer, accounting for the current and expected resource
 usage in all hospitals. The advantages of the mathematical model
 are demonstrated with simulation of the spread of COVID-19 in
 Maryland.
