Description: The evolution of the universe is based on the idea of gravitational instability,
  whereby initial tiny fluctuations in the density of the Universe grew under the
  influence of gravity to form the large-scale gravitational structures we see around
  us today. These structures bend the trajectories of Cosmic Microwave Background
  photons through gravitational lensing, distorting its primordial polarization and
  converting divergent polarization patterns (E-modes) into curled polarization patterns
  (B-Modes). Imaging the lensing-generated B-modes, the POLARBEAR telescope will be
  able to shed light on all the components of the Universe influencing structure formation,
  such as neutrino mass and dark energy.
