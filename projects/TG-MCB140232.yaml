Description: A longstanding goal of molecular simulations is to accurately predict
  the three-dimensional fold of a biopolymer given only knowledge of its primary sequence.
  Although recent work has demonstrated the successful folding of proteins ranging
  from 10-80 amino acids from the unfolded state, no comparable results exist for
  the folding of structured RNAs. In recent work, we have shown that this is a result
  of underlying inaccuracies in the energy model itself, due to underlying assumptions
  that work well for describing amino acids but are inapplicable for describing nucleic
  acids in solution. We have systematically corrected these biases in order to more
  accurately capture the inherent flexibility of single-stranded RNA loops, accurate
  base stacking energetics, and purine anti-syn interconversions. In a departure from
  traditional quantum chemistry-centric parameterization schemes, we calibrate the
  molecular mechanics potentials directly against the relevant thermodynamic and kinetic
  measurements of aqueous nucleosides and nucleotides. This application is to continue
  the kinetic, thermodynamic characterization of improved RNA force-field to enable
  de-novo RNA folding.
