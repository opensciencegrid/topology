Description: Compressed carbon dioxide is the main component of the mobile phase in
  supercritical fluid chromatography, which separates solutes according to their interactions
  with solid stationary phases. Molecular-scale properties of carbon dioxide in the
  mobile phase, confined near a stationary phase, and interacting with solutes can
  be calculated by Monte Carlo molecular simulation methods. Atomistic potentials
  for carbon dioxide, for solutes, and for the co-solvent methanol must be tested
  and refined to reliably simulate interactions at the pressure-temperature conditions
  of supercritical fluid chromatography. Simulation code now under development is
  well-suited to high-throughput computing in that it is serial, portable, and requires
  little RAM and disk storage. Because runs are long the code will be made check-pointable
  so simulations can efficiently use the Open Science Grid. The startup allocation
  requested will be to continue development of the serial simulation code, to modify
  it to allow restarting from a checkpoint file, then to test and improve atomistic
  potentials for solute and solvent molecules. It is against bulk fluid phase equilibrium
  data that potentials will be refined. Should service units remain after development
  work, computing will shift to characterizing the solvent within a few molecular
  diameters of stationary-phase and solute molecules.
