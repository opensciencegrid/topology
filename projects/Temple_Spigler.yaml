Description: This work seeks to uncover the genomic signatures of urban evolution
  in Pieris rapae, the cabbage white butterfly. Using whole genome sequencing data,
  we will explore patterns of neutral and adaptive evolution, including population
  structure, inbreeding, genetic diversity, and positive selection.
