Description: "Test Case Generation For ADAS Validation Via Cycle GAN\nToday\u2019\
  s automobile is equipped with a large amount of electronic circuits to achieve intelligent\
  \ functions, such as collision avoidance, traffic sign detection, etc., for autonomous\
  \ driving. To meet the safety standard, ensuring extremely small failure probability\
  \ over all possible operation conditions is one of the critical tasks for an autonomous\
  \ driving system. However, physically observing all these corner cases over a long\
  \ time is almost impossible in practice. In this project, we use machine learning\
  \ algorithms to efficiently generate corner cases that are not easy to observe."
