Description: "Every individual\u2019s genome carries within it the history of all\
  \ the ancestors of that individual. Thus, by analyzing a small number of genomes,\
  \ we can accurately infer the demographic history of entire human populations. This\
  \ demographic history helps establish a baseline that is needed for research and\
  \ discovery in medical genomics. \nWe are using a process to more accurately infer\
  \ the demographic history of human populations by comparing genomic statistics from\
  \ millions of genome simulations to real population genomic data. While other researchers\
  \ have worked with this process using only a few individuals or a portion of a chromosome,\
  \ we are pushing the limit of computing capabilities by simulating whole chromosomes\
  \ of hundreds of individuals. Using the whole chromosome allows us to look at more\
  \ recent demographic history, which is particularly helpful in finding genetic links\
  \ to disease processes. After publication, we will make our pipeline available so\
  \ other researchers can apply it to other populations. \nThis project pushes the\
  \ frontier of genomic research in that it uses new methods, simulates a larger part\
  \ of the genome, and is being applied to populations not yet thoroughly studied."
