Description: This Campus Champions allocation will primarily be used
  to allow USDA-ARS SCINet (https://scinet.usda.gov/) users to
  evaluate Jetstream as a possible alternative to public cloud (AWS,
  Azure) resources, which can be administratively difficult to
  obtain; as well as evaluate resources (e.g., newer GPU models) that
  are unavailable on SCINet HPC clusters.
