Description: I will be using techniques in machine learning and AI to
  better characterize the transition between the many-body localized and
  ergodic phases of the random field Heisenberg spin chain. Numerically,
  this will involve generating many disorder realizations of this model
  and calculating their spectra, and analyzing the resulting data using
  neural nets.
