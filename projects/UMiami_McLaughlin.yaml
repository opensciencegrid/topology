Description: Our overall goal is to better estimate US southeast Atlantic red snapper
  (Lutjanus campechanus) population size. Our current goal is to do so by incorporating
  close-kin mark-recapture (CKMR) data into a red snapper stock assessment model.
  We are in the process of running a simulation study to investigate how much improvements
  in parameter estimation can be achieved from including the CKMR data in the stock
  assessment model.
