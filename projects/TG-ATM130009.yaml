Description: The aim of this project is to create a global map that describes the
  functional distributions which characterize the spectraof precipitating auroral
  particles. Such a map would not only aid in efforts to model the ionosphere and
  the geospatial environment, but would also aid in the understanding of the magnetospheric
  source regions of these particles. The construction of this map will utilize programs
  that perform automated, nonlinear least squares fits of Maxwellian and Lorentzian
  distributions to data from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) suite
  of spacecraft. These programs have been developed in C under the Fedora Coredistribution
  and are statically linked against the HDF4 and GNU Scientific libraries. Initial
  testing on an AMD Athlon II X4 645quad core processor has shown that the serial
  execution of four separate instances of the Maxwellian automated fitting program
  produces fits at an average rate of 1500 spectra per hour per core, while the Lorentzian
  program, when executed in the same fashion, will  produce fits at an average rate
  of 500 spectra per hour per core. The 20-year catalog of data which we will use
  to populate this map contains roughly 200 million spectra. With these average rates,
  it would take our 16-core cluster approximately 8300 hours to fit Maxwellian distributions
  and 25,000 hours to fit Lorentzian distributions to the entire catalog. Given this
  amount of processing time and the serial nature of our programs, we wish to explore
  the feasability of using your HTC resources to complete this project.
