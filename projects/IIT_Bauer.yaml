Department: Computer Science
Description: My research advances data science in scientific computing by developing
  efficient, secure, and sustainable system solutions to manage increasingly complex
  data ecosystems. I focus on key challenges such as dynamic resource management,
  system-level optimization, data privacy, and the environmental impact of computation.
  Grounded in interdisciplinary collaboration, my work bridges theory and practice
  to enable high-impact applications, including partnerships in healthcare. https://bauer-research.net/
