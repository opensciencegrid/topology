Description: Glass-forming liquids exhibit dramatical slowdown upon cooling, which
  may be controlled by the growing amorphous order that emerges due to the rarefaction
  of metastable states in the rugged free-energy landscape. The amorphous order is
  well captured by point-to-set correlations, and their measurements are indispensable
  in testing ideas surrounding this new order parameter. To attain good statistics
  on point-to-set observables, however, requires a huge number of independent simulations.
  Exploration of many parameter ranges -- such as temperature or confinement parameters
  -- further increases the need for parallel computing. The high throughout computing
  thus provides an ideal tool for investigating the notion of the growing amorphous
  order in glassy systems.
