Description: "Proteins custom-designed for specific molecular function have great\
  \ promise to advance many areas of science and industry. High throughput methods\
  \ \u2013 in particular, effective computational modeling of structure and function\
  \ \u2013 are necessary to identify proteins with novel functions out of the vast\
  \ number of candidate protein sequences. Nevertheless, state-of-the-art methods\
  \ have only limited accuracy in predicting the functional impact of even a few mutations.\n\
  \nTo improve models for functional proteins, we are developing methods within the\
  \ Rosetta computational protein design software suite that represent subtle structural\
  \ fluctuations using flexible-backbone ensembles and integrate multiple functional\
  \ constraints on proteins (i.e. catalytic conformations or binding partners). Promising\
  \ initial results demonstrated improvement over standard fixed-backbone approaches\
  \ in initial tests against large curated mutational datasets for experimentally\
  \ determined binding affinities and high-throughput screening of protein-protein\
  \ interactions. \n\nOur approach of using discrete ensembles to model flexible and\
  \ dynamic systems is well suited to the distributed nature of high performance computing\
  \ clusters. Our goal of predicting the functional effect of defined sequences is\
  \ likewise well suited. In particular, the Open Science Grid will be very useful\
  \ for our high-processing, low-memory requirements. The purpose of this Startup\
  \ request is two-fold: benchmarking and optimizing computational methodologies to\
  \ model functional proteins. First, we will streamline our methodology for XSEDE\
  \ in preparation for a Research allocation application. Second, additional computing\
  \ resources from XSEDE will greatly expand our ability develop methodology beyond\
  \ the limitations of benchmarking on the computational resources at our home institution."
