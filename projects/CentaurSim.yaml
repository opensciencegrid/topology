Description: Centaurs are icy objects in the outer solar system whose orbits cross
  those of the giant planets. It is thought that most Centaurs originate from the
  solar system's Kuiper Belt, a reservoir of icy bodies orbiting just beyond Neptune.
  However, a few Centaurs with very large orbital inclinations and/or mean orbital
  distances cannot be well-explained with a Kuiper Belt origin. Alternatively, it
  has been proposed that these outlier Cenaturs may come from the Oort Cloud, a spherical
  halo of icy objects that extends over halfway to the nearest star. In this project
  we will simulate the production of Centaurs from the Oort Cloud using numerical
  orbital integrations. Following this, we will run our simulated orbits/objects through
  a sky survey simulator to compare our simulated "detections" with the real sample
  of known objects. Thus, we will be able to evaluate whether the Oort Cloud is a
  potential source of Centaurs with extreme orbits.
