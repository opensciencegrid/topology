Description: The proposed project aims to decrease the management overhead and code
  complexity of trajectory analysis from particle simulation data. Particle simulations
  produce trajectories, which are encoded by a stream of high-dimensional vectors
  (frames).  Analysis on this data usually takes a map-reduce form consisting of mapping
  each frame to successively smaller vectors of descriptors.From this starting point,
  two typical data analysis cases will be considered.  The first is statistical, through
  construction of order statistics, histograms, cumulants, or weighted averages.  We
  will develop code generation methods to handle general nonlinear analysis functions.  The
  second analysis goes one step further by fitting the analyzed data to an assumed
  functional form using Bayesian inference.Due to the map-reduce structure of these
  computations, these analysis methods can be parallelized while retaining a high-level
  programming model.  This task requires automated consideration of data movement
  and task separation to match available computational resources.  The result will
  be published under an open source license, and be immediately useful to computational
  chemistry and biology applications analyzing large molecular dynamics simulations.This
  work will make use of the open science grid and Pegasus software as well as the
  TACC Longhorn data analysis cluster for systems and application comparison.  Project
  code storage on XWFS and scratch access on TACC will also be needed.  FutureGrid
  may be explored for compatibility with the Unicore workflow specification and Pegasus
  if its production status is extended past September.
