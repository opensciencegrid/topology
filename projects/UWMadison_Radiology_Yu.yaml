Description: 'The Yu lab is currently aligned along three major thematic and interrelated
  areas of interest: (1) examining the impact of genes, the environment, and gene-environment
  interactions on quantitative brain microstructure in neurocognitive and neuropsychiatric
  illness; (2) biological validation and clinical translation of methodological innovations
  in diffusion weighted MRI for accurate diagnosis and tracking therapeutic outcomes
  in patient care, clinical trials, and patient-oriented research; and (3) development
  of MR and PET neuroimaging methods for the sensitive detection and characterization
  of microglial-driven neuroinflammation and synaptic loss in neurologic and psychiatric
  disease.'
