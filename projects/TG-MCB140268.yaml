Description: "The genome of many viruses is represented by a long single-stranded\
  \ ribonucleic acid (RNA)  molecule that appears to fold into a highly compact organized\
  \ structure inside the viral shell. Such structure contains a variety of topological\
  \ motifs, such as hairpins, bulges, multi-loops, and notably RNA pseudoknots.  RNA\
  \ pseudoknots play an important role also in natural RNAs for structural, regulatory\
  \ and catalytic functions in various biological processes. In particular, it has\
  \ been recently recognized an interesting interplay between the shape, structure\
  \ and assembly of icosahedral viral capsids, and the compact RNA packaging topology.\
  \  The topology of RNA pseudoknots can be effectively studied by using Random Matrix\
  \ Theory (RMT), by exploiting a correspondence between a graphical representation\
  \ of RNA structures with pseudoknots and Feynman diagrams of a particular field\
  \ theory of large random matrices. The theoretical framework of RMT provides a natural\
  \ analytic tool for the prediction and classification of pseudoknots, since all\
  \ Feynman diagrams can be organized in a mathematical series, called topological\
  \ expansion. The PI is interested in studying numerically some recent matrix models\
  \ based on RMT to describe the structure of viral RNA encapsidated in a viral icosahedral\
  \ shell.  The PI has long experience in the application of RMT to the study of RNA\
  \ pseudoknots with RMT, as well as on the simulation of the geometry and shapes\
  \ of icosahedral shells.  \nThe simulations the PI intends to perform on XSEDE are\
  \ Monte Carlo runs of large stochastic matrices, since the matrix model is naturally\
  \ formulated as zero-dimensional SU(N) field theory  of  Hermitian matrices.  The\
  \ number of matrices L is equal to number of nucleotides of the RNA molecules, which\
  \ in viral RNAs can be of the order of L~10^3.  Past preliminary studies showed\
  \ that the size N of the matrices should be sufficiently large to appreciate topological\
  \ corrections of the order 1/N^2 and 1/N^4 (at least), which implies the simulation\
  \ of Hermitian random matrices of order N~24 or N~32. Since the number of degrees\
  \ of freedom for each matrix is N^2~1024, the configuration space has L*N^2~ 10^6\
  \ degrees of freedom. While matrix multiplication can benefit of parallel computing\
  \ capabilities, the need of performing Monte Carlo simulations orients the PI to\
  \ request High Throughput Computing resources for this initial XSEDE Startup application.\
  \ Such initial experience will provide the PI a baseline to evaluate the possibility\
  \ to steer future versions of the code towards HPC capabilities, including GPU or\
  \ CPU-GPU clusters. Current local computational capabilities are sufficient for\
  \ developing the codes and running toy-model simulations (N~4), but do not satisfy\
  \ the PI\u2019s needs for research purposes of large realistic systems. Therefore,\
  \ XSEDE startup resources are requested to test larger systems, optimize the code\
  \ and explore code\u2019s scalability, as well as familiarize with the XSEDE platform.\n\
