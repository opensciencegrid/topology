Description: The outer solar system has been a topic of intense scientific research
  for twenty-five years, but particularly within the past year. In January 2016, astronomers
  Mike Brown and Konstantin Batygin announced ``Planet Nine'' -- a hypothetical 10
  Earth-mass object in the distant solar system responsible for the statistically
  significant orbital clustering of the longest-period trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs).
  Since this announcement, several more long-period TNOs have been discovered. Our
  specific research focus is studying the orbital dynamics of these objects, both
  absent of and in the presence of a Planet Nine, with the ultimate goal of determining
  the mostly likely orbit of a potential Planet Nine. Such a study requires numerical
  N-body simulations of hundreds of ``clones'' of each object, where a clone is produced
  by varying the orbital elements of an object within uncertainties. These simulations
  must encompass the entirety of the solar system's history after the formation of
  the planets, or approximately 4.5 billion years. Additionally, we must conduct these
  simulations for a suite of potential Planet Nines, further increasing the computational
  demand. We intend to ascertain which simulations, and therefore which configurations
  of Planet Nine, allow for the dynamical survival and force the orbital alignment
  of the longest period TNOs. The computational demand for these simulations far exceeds
  what is available to us on a laptop or desktop computer, and therefore we are requesting
  a Startup allocation on OSG to complete this work.
