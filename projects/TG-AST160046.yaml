Description: "Our ultimate goal with this proposal is to understand how magnetic dynamos\
  \ work on stars other than the Sun.   To do\n the science we propose which is to\
  \ measure the typical starspot lifetime as a function of rotation rate and stellar\
  \ mass and derive the starspot number and the spatial starspot distribution for\
  \ stars other than the Sun, we must apply our light curve model\ning program to\
  \ the full duration (4 years) of publicly available short cadence Kepler time series\
  \ photometry of as many of our targets as possible. We must run the code many times\
  \ per target in a Monte Carlo fashion in order to explore the full parameter s\n\
  pace of potential solutions. We must also do trials with different numbers of starspots\
  \ in order to determine the optimal number of spots necessary to fit the light curves.\
  \   For this initial research allocation, we proposal to use the Open Science Grid\
  \ to\n do a series of runs for 5 high priority targets:  HAT-P-11, Kepler-17, Kepler-63,\
  \ KOI-340, and KOI-1786, using our STSP code designed specifically for high throughput\
  \ computing.  The core code for the work has already been completed. Now, we need\
  \ to run i\nt many times in many different configurations in order extract the scientific\
  \ results. This mode of operating is well suited to training the young students\
  \ and scientists that will do this work."
