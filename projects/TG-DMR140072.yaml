Description: When bulk helium-4 is cooled below T = 2.18 K, it undergoes a thermodynamic
  phase transition to a superfluid, characterized by zero viscosity and quantization
  of flow.  The superfluid state of matter is a macroscopic manifestation of quantum
  mechanics, as it can be described by a single complex wave function with a phase
  that does not depend on position.  The phase coherence can be probed in a container
  filled with helium-4, by reducing one or more of its dimensions until they are smaller
  than the coherence length; the spatial distance over which order propagates.  As
  this dimensional reduction occurs, enhanced thermal and quantum fluctuations push
  the transition to the superfluid state to lower temperatures.  However, this trend
  can be countered via the proximity effect, where a bulk 3D superfluid is coupled
  to a low (2D) dimensional superfluid via a weak link producing superfluid correlations
  in the film at temperatures above the Kosterlitz-Thouless temperature. Recent experiments
  probing the coupling between 3D and 2D superfluid helium-4 have uncovered an anomalously
  large proximity effect, leading to an enhanced superfluid density that cannot be
  explained using the correlation length alone.We intend to explore the microscopic
  origin of this enhanced proximity effect via large scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations
  of helium-4 in a topologically non-trivial geometry that incorporates the important
  aspects of the experiments.  We will modify, test and deploy our research group's
  home-built high performance worm algorithm path integral quantum Monte Carlo code
  (http://code.delmaestro.org) at low temperatures with an eye toward improving efficiency
  through enhanced parallelization and hybridization.
