Description: 'Molecular-scale interaction between mobile and stationary

  phases as they relate to supercritical fluid chromatography

  (SFC) is modeled with hybrid Monte Carlo methods. Carbon dioxide is the main component
  of the mobile phase in SFC, which typically operates above the critical point. Simulations
  use seven mole percent methanol in the mobile phase. The objective of the proposed
  work is understanding the interaction between mobile-phase molecules and the alkylsilane-coated
  silica stationary phase. The computational method is Monte Carlo simulation. Hybrid
  molecular dynamics moves explore conformations of eighteen-carbon alkylsilane chains
  bonded to silica substrate.'
