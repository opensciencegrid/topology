Description: This project aims to identify naturally derived molecules with the potential
  to inhibit VP37, a key orthopoxvirus protein targeted by the antiviral drug Tecovirimat.
  Using GROMACS for molecular dynamics simulations and AutoDock Vina for molecular
  docking, we will screen candidates from the COCONUT natural product database. ACCESS
  resources will be used to support MD simulations, and molecular docking.
