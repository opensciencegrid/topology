Description: "The Geography of Human Flourishing research project aims to analyze\
  \ Harvard\u2019s archive of 10 billion geolocated tweets (spanning from 2010 to\
  \ mid-2023) through the lens of the six dimensions of human flourishing defined\
  \ by the Global Flourishing Study (GFS) [Happiness and life satisfaction; Mental\
  \ and physical health; Meaning and purpose; Character and virtue; Close social relationships;\
  \ Material and financial stability].\nUsing fine-tuned large language models (LLMs),\
  \ the project extracts 46 indicators aligned with these six domains, generating\
  \ high-resolution spatio-temporal datasets. The initiative also develops interactive\
  \ tools to visualize and analyze these patterns across space and time."
