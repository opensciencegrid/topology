  The dynamics and static properties of glassy systems can be studied in great detail
  by simple model systems, either those on a lattice or those consisting of mixtures
  of spherical particles. In order to do that, one can use any many techniques generally
  under the umbrella of Monte Carlo Sampling or Molecular Dynamics. In order to get
  detailed properties, is is often advantageous or necessary to run a large number
  of independent simulations, and to calculate properties averaged over these simulations.
  It may also be necessary to study these systems with a range of parameter values,
  e.g. temperature or system size. Hence, this problem lends itself well to high throughput
  computing, at least for cases where the individual simulations comprising a workflow
  are not too long.'
