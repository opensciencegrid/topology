Description: 'The George E. Brown Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation
  (NEES) project is a National Science Foundation funded project operating a shared
  national network of civil engineering experimental facilities that seeks to develop
  effective ways of mitigating earthquake damage and loss of life using improved designs,
  materials, construction techniques, and monitoring methods. Safer buildings and
  civil infrastructure are needed to reduce damage and loss from earthquakes and tsunamis.
  Preparing for and protecting against these threats makes American communities more
  resilient to future disasters. To support research in the Civil Engineering community
  that seeks to address these problems, NEES operates 14 distributed research equipment
  sites across the United States. The objectives of NEES are to: develop a national
  and multi-user research infrastructure to enable research and innovation in earthquake
  and tsunami loss reduction; create an educated workforce in hazard mitigation; and
  conduct broader outreach and lifelong learning activities. Experimental capabilities
  at the 14 NEES sites include large-scale shake tables, a tsunami wave basin, large-scale
  testing facilities, centrifuges, field and mobile facilities, a large-scale displacement
  facility, and cyberinfrastructure capabilities. NEEScomm, led by Purdue University,
  connects the 14 NEES research equipment sites and the earthquake engineering community
  with a powerful information technology infrastructure and a commitment to education,
  outreach and training related to earthquake engineering. The center facilitates
  community collaboration and discovery by working to advance research based on experimentation
  and computational simulations of the performance of buildings, bridges, utility
  systems, coastal regions, and geomaterials during seismic events. In conjunction
  with supporting research, NEES seeks to disseminate results through education, outreach,
  and training to reduce the devastation and loss of human life from earthquakes and
  tsunamis. Through a cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation,
  the NEEScomm center is charged with leading and managing the operations of this
  national resource, and enabling collaboration between the 14 NEES research equipment
  sites and the earthquake engineering community through groundbreaking cyberinfrastructure,
  education and outreach efforts. NEES provides access to a variety of analysis and
  simulation tools for the NEES community, which includes OpenSees, OpenFresco, UI-SimCor,
  RDV, and Data Turbine. A groundbreaking cyberinfrastructure, the NEEShub (http://www.nees.org),
  connects researchers, practitioners, and the greater civil engineering community
  with the 14 research labs. NEEShub features the NEES Project Warehouse, which archives
  data gathered in all NEES experiments, along with a rich set of tools for data management,
  data viewing, and computational simulation. Most projects include, in addition to
  physical experimentation, a substantial computational component for comparison with
  and validation of the physical tests. As part of the Information Technology services
  provided to the NEES community, NEEScomm is expected to provide production quality
  cyberinfrastructure that is reliable and relevant to the needs of the NEES community,
  and to provide facilitated access to and use of campus and/or national computing
  resources. This proposal seeks to continue and extend the support for computational
  experiments in the NEES research community.'
