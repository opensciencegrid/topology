Description: This research project will focus on using high performance computing
  for accelerating the numerical methods for modeling the flows of viscoelastic liquids.
  The computational schemes developed for studying viscoelastic flows are based on
  an adaptive finite-volume discretization of the Navier-Stokes equations combined
  with various constitutive laws for viscoelastic liquids. The numerical method is
  based on a volume of fluid algorithm for tracking the interface, in case of the
  presence of a second phase. The numerical framework has parallel support using the
  MPI library, dynamic load-balancing, and parallel offline visualization. The parallel
  performance of the code will be tested and improved upon. Adaptivity combined with
  parallelization are essential components of the numerical framework, since transient
  computations of viscoelastic flows are often very intensive (due to small timestep
  and high mesh resolution required to resolve high stress regions) and therefore
  require a large computational resources.
