Description: >
  In this work, we will develop a coarse-grained semiclassical method 
  to simulate quantum dynamics of coupled electron-phonon systems. 
  First, we will benchmark our method against exact numerical approaches and 
  then combine with ab-initio calculations. Using our approach, we will also 
  investigate quantum dynamical effects in materials strongly coupled to quantized light.
