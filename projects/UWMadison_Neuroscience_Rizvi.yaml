Description: >-
  My research group focuses on studying how patterns of gene
  regulation, at the level of single cells and spatially resolved,
  mediate homeostatic function within the central nervous system. We
  compare these results against neurodegenerative disease states,
  seeking to understand the molecular and cellular basis for
  dysfunction.
