Description: A machine learning-based 3D reconstruction of highly porous
  cement samples cured in a microgravity environment is being pursued.
  The approach follows a deep learning-based framework based on the solid
  texture synthesis method, widely adopted in the computer graphics
  community. Preliminary results https://doi.org/10.2514/6.2023-2025
  showed promising results, and with increased computational resources,
  larger exemplars higher resolution will be used for 3D reconstruction.
