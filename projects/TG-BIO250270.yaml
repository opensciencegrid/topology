Description: "Despite rapid advances in synthetic organic chemistry, many classes\
  \ of small molecules remain inefficient to access using conventional methods. Enzymatic\
  \ reactions, on the other hand, offer unparalleled potential for highly selective\
  \ chemical transformations. By combining the power of modern enzyme engineering\
  \ tools and advances in genome mining, The Renata laboratory aims to develop practical\
  \ enzymatic solutions for traditionally challenging organic reactions, especially\
  \ in the realm of C\u2013H functionalization chemistry. The utility of these transformations\
  \ will be showcased in the concise, scalable synthesis of bioactive natural products\
  \ and their analogues, which in turn will serve as potential leads in drug discovery\
  \ efforts or novel chemical probes to interrogate various cellular processes. Research\
  \ projects are designed to be multi-faceted, providing students with broad exposure\
  \ to synthetic organic chemistry, molecular biology, enzyme engineering and medicinal\
  \ chemistry to ensure that they are well-equipped for future careers in both academia\
  \ and industry. \uFF08https://renatalab.com/research/\uFF09"
