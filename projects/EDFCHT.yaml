Description: The project looks into the use of heteroskedasticity consistent variance-covariance
  estimators for conducting hypothesis testing. It uses Monte Carlo and bootstrap
  techniques to find the distribution of t-statistics using heteroskedasticity consistent
  variance-covariance estimator under normality and nonnormality. Comparison between
  using different heteroskedasticity consistent estimators are included and possible
  corrections are proposed and will be examined.
