Description: The Comparison of Protein Active Site Structures (CPASS) database and
  software is used as part of our FAST-NMR assay to assign the function of a hypothetical
  protein or a protein of unknown function. The CPASS database and software enable
  the comparison of experimentally identified ligand binding sites to infer biological
  function and aid in drug discovery. The CPASS database is comprised of unique ligand-defined
  active sites identified in the Protein Data Bank, and the CPASS program compares
  these ligand-defined active sites to determine sequence and structural similarity
  without maintaining sequence connectivity, along with ligand similarity, if desired.
  CPASS will compare any set of ligand-defined protein active sites irrespective of
  the identity of the bound ligand.
