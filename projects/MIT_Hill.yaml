Description: This is for NSF-NASA efforts to create very large
  realistic models of the Earths oceans
  ( https://data.nas.nasa.gov/ecco/ ). Some of our largest
  modeling efforts produce multi-petabyte solutions and we are
  experimenting with sharing via the NSF Open Storage Network to provide
  broad open access to datasets that are increasingly
  widely used. We are interested in undertaking high-throughput analysis
  to identify ocean vorticity feature statistics in different
  model solutions to better understand air-sea feedbacks that are
  significant for better modeling climate processes. We are also
  interested in creating scripts that we can share widely with
  downstream users throughout the US and globally. We will be using
  the OSN object store accessed through the Python s3fs and xarray
  tools. These allow high concurrency access for reading
  different objects within the project OSN S3 buckets.
