Department: National Synchrotron Light Source II
Description: Using magnetic field measurements taken in the lab of undulators and
  wigglers we will compute the downstream photon spectrum and distributions for many
  configurations of many of the NSLS2 insertion devices, including wavefront propagation
  and beamline simulation where needed.
