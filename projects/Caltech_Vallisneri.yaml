Description: >
  The NANOGrav collaboration is a cross-university, cross-discipline collection of astrophysicists, 
  data analysts, and engineers who are currently working to detect a gravitational wave background 
  via Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs).  Our group's current projects are related to cross-validation and 
  posterior predictive checking methods for parameter estimation and detection analyses for Bayesian 
  PTA studies. Another project is related to increasing computational efficiency of PTA analyses by 
  developing likelihood reweighting methods for PTAs. More information on NANOGrav can be
