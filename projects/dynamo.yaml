Description: Equilibrium dynamical models are useful tools for inferring the mass
  distribution of galaxies and determining the amount and structure of their dark
  matter halos. The goal of this work is to explore degeneracies in the modeling of
  elliptical galaxies to evaluate how well we can understand properties such as their
  dark matter density distribution, the mass-to-light ratio of their stellar populations,
  and the orbital anisotropy of various tracer populations.
