Description: 'We propose to use multiple XSEDE resources to study several scientific
  problems. This work is built on theextensive efforts over the past three years we
  have carried out within a wide range of computational science,cyberinfrastructure
  and computer science projects, requiring us to use concurrent multiple resources
  onXSEDE. Specifically, in this proposal we request 10.04M on Stampede, 2.07M on
  Kraken, 0.37M on Tres-tles and 0.1M on Blacklight for four distinct projects: (i)
  Atomisitic simulation of Physiological Systems;Extensible and Scalable middleware
  and tools for XSEDE and Open Science Grid.This proposal is fundamentally multi-disciplinary
  and collaborative. Importantly resources being re-quested are part of and supported
  by multiple federally funded and even International funded projects (inconjunction
  with NSF). This work is primarily funded by NSF CAREER Award (OCI-1253644; PI Jha),
  aswell as by NSF Cyber-enabled Discovery and Innovation Award (CHE-1125332; co-PI
  Jha), NSF-ExTENCIergy Award (ASCR, DE-FG02-12ER26115, PI Jha). A significant grant
  (ExTASY) as part of the US-UKNSF-EPSRC call in Chemsitry has been awarded at the
  UK end and is awaiting processing at the US end.'
