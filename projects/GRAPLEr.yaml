Description: The GLEON Research And PRAGMA Lake Expedition (GRAPLE) is a collaborative
  effort between computer science and lake ecology researchers.  It aims to
  improve our understanding and predictive capacity of the threats to the
  water quality of our freshwater resources, including climate change.
  GRAPLEr is a distributed computing system used to address the modeling needs
  of GRAPLE researchers. GRAPLEr integrates and applies overlay virtual
  network, high-throughput computing, and Web service technologies in a novel
  way. First, its user-level IP-over-P2P (IPOP) overlay network allows compute
  and storage resources distributed across independently-administered
  institutions (including private and public clouds) to be aggregated into a
  common virtual network, despite the presence of firewalls and network
  address translators. Second, resources aggregated by the IPOP virtual
  network run unmodified high-throughput computing middleware (HTCondor) to
  enable large numbers of model simulations to be executed concurrently across
  the distributed computing resources. Third, a Web service interface allows
  end users to submit job requests to the system using client libraries that
  integrate with the R statistical computing environment.
