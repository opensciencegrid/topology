Description: "In order to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, experts have proposed requiring\
  \ major carbon dioxide emitters to modify their infrastructure to collect carbon\
  \ dioxide exhaust and compress it into a super-critical fluid for injection into\
  \ a well-sealed geologic structure such as an exhausted oil or natural gas reservoir.\
  \ We are therefore developing a tool to assess and monitor potential carbon capture\
  \ and storage sites. \n\nWe use large-scale reservoir simulations to investigate\
  \ the mechanical stresses that would effect a reservoir as it is injected with super-critical\
  \ carbon dioxide. Since we will not know the precise geologic structure of a given\
  \ field site, this requires us to run a very large number of computationally-intensive\
  \ simulations (10$^4$-10$^7$) in order to adequately investigate every possible\
  \ geologic structure. These simulations can then be compared to measurements from\
  \ the surface and from wells drilled into the reservoir, allowing us to identify\
  \ which proposed structures best explain the data. This will allow us to infer the\
  \ structure and state of the subsurface."
