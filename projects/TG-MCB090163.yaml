Description: 'This proposal requests CPU time on XSEDE resources for research aimed
  at understanding assembly and pattern formation in biological and biomimetic systems.
  The first two subprojects will use coarse-grained simulations to explore two processes
  which are essential for replication of many viruses: the assembly of capsid proteins
  around RNA and the simultaneous assembly and budding of capsid proteins through
  lipid bilayers. The third subproject will study pattern formation and spontaneous
  flow in a far-from-equilibrium system containing microtubules and motor proteins
  studied by our experimental collaborators, the Dogic Lab at Brandeis. A common goal
  in each of the three subprojects is to reveal structural and dynamical information
  about key intermediates which are not accessible to experiments. The simulations
  of capsid assembly around RNA will be performed with the program HOOMD which enables
  great computational speedups on GPUs. The simulations of capsids assembling on lipid
  bilayers will use LAMMPS which affords excellent scaling for the large membranes
  being considered. The simulations of microtubules and motor proteins will use a
  self-written code optimized to characterize high aspect ratio, extensile bundles.
  Funding for Subprojects 1 & 2 is provided by NIH NIAID (R01AI080791) and Subproject
  3 is funded by the NSF (NSF-MRSEC-0820492).'
