Description: 'Robust Decision Making on Climate and Energy Policy (RDCEP)


  The Center for Robust Decision Making on Climate and Energy Policy conducts research
  in four main areas:


  * Improving the fidelity of models used to forecast the impact of policies on future
  economic and climatic conditions. Many of the most decision-relevant aspects of
  climate and energy policy - for example, climate impacts and technological advances
  - are poorly or not at all represented in current policy analysis tools. The Center
  will build representations of the most important processes and increase model detail
  and resolution.

  * Quantifying sensitivities and uncertainties in the parameters, processes, and
  impacts in models. RDCEP will develop methods to characterize the dependence of
  model output on input, parameter, and model uncertainty; incorporate these uncertainties
  in models; and study how to communicate probabilistic model output to decision makers.

  * Identifying robust decisions in the face of uncertainty. The best policy is not
  necessarily that which produces the maximum return if all assumptions made are borne
  out, but the one that balances return and risk in the face of many uncertainties.
  The Center will develop models to identify robust strategies that perform well over
  a wide range of scenarios.

  * Developing improved computational methods and numerical methods required to achieve
  these goals. New parallel stochastic dynamic programming, robust optimal control,
  and numerical optimization methods able to make full use of modern supercomputers
  will allow tools developed at the Center to incorporate sectoral and process detail
  and explore uncertainty, in ways not previously possible.'
