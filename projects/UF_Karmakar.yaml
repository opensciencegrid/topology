Description: In this project we explore comparative forecasting performance of different
  sequence of nested models. In this day and time of large parameter based models
  such as Neural nets or LLM, it has become important to understand whether a parsimonious
  (less parameters) model can yield forecasts of statistically equal accuracy. This
  project explores this forecasting comparison via different econometric metric and
  aims to establish theoretical foundation. Some of the related publications can be
