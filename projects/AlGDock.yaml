Description: 'Binding Potential of Mean Force Calculations with Alchemical Interaction
  Grids


  Standard binding free energies are frequently sought in drug design. According to
  implicit ligand theory, standard binding free energies can be determined from binding
  potential of mean force (PMF) calculations from different receptor structures. Binding
  PMFs are a special type of binding free energy in which the receptor is rigid. The
  purpose of this project is to develop methods for estimating binding PMFs.'
