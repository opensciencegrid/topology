Description: The use of methylation-specific restriction enzymes to preferentially
  cleave 5'-CCGG-3' sites in conjunction with Next Generation Sequencing platforms
  has formed the basis for the widely used Methyl-seq and HELP-tagging assays. The
  recent development of an R package using a Bayesian hierarchical model approach,
  msBayes, offered a statistically rigorous alternative to the basic tag-counting/geometric
  mapping previously used for these two techniques. Its dependence on the WinBUGS
  package however, severely limited its performance and usage by the community. We
  have re-implemented msBayes to make use of both OpenBUGS and OpenMP, and have integrated
  this new core module, msBayes2.0, into a web-based platform and subsequent deployment
  and processing on a diversity of computing platforms.
