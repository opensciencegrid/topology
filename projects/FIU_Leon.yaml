Description: 'This research focuses on investigating the impact of urban tree canopies
  and green infrastructure on microclimatic conditions, particularly in mitigating
  the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect in tropical climates. Using Computational Fluid
  Dynamics (CFD) simulations in OpenFOAM, the study models heat transfer, airflow,
  and solar radiation distribution in urban environments with varying vegetation density.
  Environmental parameters such as air temperature, humidity, solar radiation, and
  wind speed are measured using on-site sensors, including HOBO light and weather
  sensors, to validate and calibrate the simulation results.


  The study specifically analyzes how tree crown structure, height, and leaf density
  affect local cooling potential, shading, and radiation absorption under different
  solar conditions. Radiation models like fvDOM with solarLoad integration and solarOpticalProperties
  are used to simulate the interaction between solar energy and vegetation.


  Results are used to inform urban planning and sustainable landscape design, providing
  evidence-based recommendations for green infrastructure strategies to improve thermal
  comfort and environmental quality in urban areas.'
