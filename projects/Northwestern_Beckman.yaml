Description: This project develops a scalable, AI-powered image search system for
  the Sage national-scale edge computing cyberinfrastructure, enabling semantic retrieval
  across our database of sensor images. The system integrates AI models for captioning
  and embedding, hybrid vector/keyword search, and reranking to support scientific
  analysis in domains such as ecology and atmospheric science. More details are available
