Description: Why would a genotypically homogeneous population of cells live to different
  ages? We propose a mathematical model of cellular aging based on gene interaction
  network.  This model network is made of only non-aging components, and interactions
  among genes are inherently stochastic. Death of a cell occurs in the model when
  an essential gene loses all of its interactions. The key characteristic of aging,
  the exponential increase of mortality rate over time, can arise from this model
  network with non-aging components. Hence, cellular aging is an emergent property
  of this model network. The model predicts that the rate of aging, defined by the
  Gompertz coefficient, is proportional to the number of active interactions per gene
  and that stochastic heterogeneity is an important factor in shaping the dynamics
  of the aging process. Hence, the Gompertz parameter is a proxy of network robustness.
  Preliminary studies on how aging is influenced by power-law configuration, synthetic
  lethal interaction, and allelic interactions will be presented. A general framework
  to study network aging as a quantitative trait will be studied, and the implication
  on missing heritability will be investigated. Empirical results to support these
  theoretic studies will also be presented. Preprint for the basic model is available
