Department: Library and Information Technology Services (LITS)
Description: In my role as a data science instructional support coordinator, I design
  and lead workshops, develop hands-on tutorials, and offer office hours for faculty,
  staff, and students engaged in computational and data intensive work. I support
  skill-building across a range of tools and languages - such as Python, R, Git, and
  Jupyter - and help users navigate research workflows involving data analysis, visualization,
  and reproducibility. I also consult on project planning, infrastructure needs, and
  integrating ethical and equitable practices into data-driven research.
