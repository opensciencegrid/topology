Description: Analysis of modern surgery presents many interesting computational challenges.
  The problems of access to data, data analysis, and interpretation of said analysis
  all present fundamental, unsolved difficulties to those in medical informatics.
  The focus of this project primarily involves data analysis where operations are
  still typically thought of holistically and conceptually, rather than algorithmically.
  This work is an attempt to change that by properly defining surgical procedures
  in a manner conducive to both education and analysis.
