Description: "Network Research, Cybersecurity, and Technology Impact Research comprise\
  \ the scope of our scholarship. Merit Research seeks to inspire and advance innovation\
  \ in networking and cybersecurity. We also seek to increase the understanding of\
  \ the societal impacts of technology, broadband and information access for the purpose\
  \ of making the world a better place to learn, discover, work and live.\n\nThe\_\
  National Distributed Network Telescope (NDNT)\_is a nationwide initiative led by\_\
  Merit Network\_to build a collaborative infrastructure for analyzing unsolicited\
  \ Internet traffic\u2014also known as\_darknet data.\nA network telescope is a system\
  \ that monitors unused portions of the Internet\u2019s address space to collect\
  \ and analyze traffic that was not intentionally sent to a live host. This data\
  \ offers a unique window into global Internet activity, allowing researchers to\
  \ study scanning behavior, attacks, and other anomalous events that help strengthen\
  \ cybersecurity."
