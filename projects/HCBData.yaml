Description: The project aims to achieve explainable machine learning (ML) through
  the integration of structured semantic data with the inputs, outputs and hidden
  layers of deep learning systems. The proliferation of explicitly structured semantic
  data has occurred in parallel with the emergence of powerful ML algorithms, particularly
  deep neural networks (DNNs), whose internal layers encode information implicitly.
  This research attempts to bridge the gap between explicit, easy-to-understand semantic
  information and implicit, difficult-to-understand features of a deep learning system
  to achieve transparency and trust in an algorithm's reasoning across multiple layers.
