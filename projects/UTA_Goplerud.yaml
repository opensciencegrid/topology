Description: I create new methods to facilitate political science research by leveraging
  the intersection of Bayesian methods and machine learning. My papers create new
  methods to tackle a variety of common problems (heterogeneous effects, hierarchical
  models, ideal point estimation) where existing methods have limitations that constrain
  substantive researchers. My existing papers can be found on my website https://mgoplerud.com/
  as well as on pre-print servers such as arxiv.
