Description: Monte Carlo molecular simulation together with a coarse-grained model
  is used to study the single-stranded to double-stranded transition in DNA both in
  solution and with one strand bound to a surface.  Representing DNA microarrays,
  hybridization on a surface is studied and the effect of surface density, strand
  length and sequence homology on duplex stability is investigated.  Results can better
  inform empirical surface hybridization models.
