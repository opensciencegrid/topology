Description: Graph theory analyses would be investigated on weighted undirected matrices
  based on the probability of white matter connectivity between 26 regions comprising
  both cortical and subcortical structures on children with epilepsy with and without
  anxiety disorders. This project aims at investigating if there are fundamental differences
  in structural connectivity in children with idiopathic epilepsy with and without
  anxiety comorbidity. The neuropsychological implications of potential differences
  between groups would also be investigated.
