Description: Atomically-detailed simulation methods (e.g. Molecular Dynamics, Monte Carlo and quantum chemistry methods) are used to develop models of molecular separations based on adsorption in structured nanoporous materials. These materials include zeolites, metal-organic framework materials, activated carbons and polymers. A long-term goal is the discovery of new adsorbent materials for a diverse range of chemical separations, a problem for which a very large search space exists.
