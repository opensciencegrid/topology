Description: 'The molecular machines associated with biological membranes are particularly
  remarkable. Membrane-associated proteins play an essential role in controlling the
  bidirectional flow of material and information, and as such, they are truly devices
  able to accomplish complex tasks. These include ion channels, transporters, pumps,
  receptors, kinases, and phosphatases.

  These proteins, like any machine, need to change shape and visit many conformational
  states to perform their function. Our project is aimed at gaining a deep mechanistic
  perspective of such protein function, linking structure to dynamics, by characterizing
  the free energy landscape that governs the key functional motions.'
