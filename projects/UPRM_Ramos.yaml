Description: At present we are conducting molecular dynamics
  simulations to study the interaction of peptides and membranes.
  We are aiming at understanding the mechanisms (mechanical and/or
  electroestatic) that are involved in the formation of pores in
  membranes. In order to study these systems we are performing
  molecular dynamics simulations with NAMD and different force
  fields like charmm to simulate the formation of the pores.
