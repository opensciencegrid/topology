Description: LBNE will endeavor to perform precision measurements of key parameters
  pertaining to neutrino oscillations, advancing our understanding of some of the
  most fundamental issues in particle physics, such as neutrino mass hierarchy, nucleon
  decay and a few other others. The Software and Computing Organization of LBNE is
  tasked with providing core infrastructure for its Physics Tools development and
  data processing, which will need to accommodate the needs of a diverse and distributed
  research organization.
