Description: The discovery of a Higgs-like particle, announced in June 2012 by CERN,
  was a defining moment in the field of high energy physics. The excitement of this
  finding was felt world-wide and is a breakthrough in our understanding of the Universe
  at a fundamental level.   Saying therefore that we now live in a post-Higgs era
  in high energy physics is no exaggeration. This breakthrough by the Large Hadron
  Collider (LHC) is just a first step towards testing much extensive theories such
  as supersymmetry and grand unification. Computing tools played an important role
  in the discovery of the Higgs and the need for these tools to explore ideas beyond
  the Standard Model is ever increasing. Resources like XSEDE therefore provide an
  opportunity to use cutting edge computing tools in order to explore novel ideas
  in high energy physics. Our startup allocation of 150,000 SU's resulted in four
  peer reviewed publications. With the second allocation of 3 million SUs our group
  managed to  complete 10 articles out of which 7 have been published in peer reviewed
  journals and three are in process. The data for two other projects have been collected.
  These projects resulted from the consumption of only 32% of the total SUs that were
  allocated. Our consumption of the SUs was much less than anticipated since we have
  improved the computing techniques we use in our projects. We are therefore requesting
  an extension of our current SUs since a surplus of SUs is always useful for us to
  pursue projects even if the SU requirement is high.
