Description: The global distribution of precipitating auroral particles is a crucial
  input to models of the magnetosphere and the coupling between the magnetosphere-ionosphere.
  In particular, the spectral distributions which can be used to characterize the
  shape of precipitating electron spectra are equally important inputs to models and
  can be used provide information about the magnetospheric source regions of the precipitating
  particles. We detail the need for and the development of maps of characterized particle
  spectra and present a case for a resource request to aid with the development of
  these maps.
