Description: "The Kepler Mission has detected dozens of compact planetary systems\
  \ with more than four transiting planets. This sample provides a collection of close-packed\
  \ planetary systems with relatively little spread in the inclination angles of the\
  \ inferred orbits. A large fraction of the observational sample contains limited\
  \ multiplicity, begging the question whether there is a true diversity of multi-transiting\
  \ systems, or if some systems merely possess high mutual inclinations, allowing\
  \ them to appear as single-transiting systems in a transit-based survey. Planet\
  \ formation is an active yet poorly understood field: insight to the histories and\
  \ dynamics of multi-planet systems would be helpful towards understanding planet\
  \ formation as a whole. \n\nIn previous work, we have determined the regimes of\
  \ parameter space for which orbital inclinations can be effectively excited by planet-planet\
  \ interactions among the currently observed bodies. We found that the orbital inclination\
  \ angles are not spread out appreciably through self-excitation.  In contrast, we\
  \ found that the two Kepler multi-planet systems with additional non-transiting\
  \ planets are susceptible to oscillations of their inclination angles, which means\
  \ their currently observed configurations could be due to planet-planet interactions\
  \ alone. The multi-planet compact Kepler systems are found to be remarkably stable\
  \ to oscillations of their inclination angles. The oscillations of inclination found\
  \ in our previous work inform the recently suggested dichotomy in the sample of\
  \ solar systems observed by Kepler. However, it would also be useful to study the\
  \ behaviors of these systems with perturbing companions. This would enable a better\
  \ understanding of the observed systems, resulting in a more accurate exoplanet\
  \ population census. To do this, we must perform computationally intensive calculations\
  \ and simulations."
