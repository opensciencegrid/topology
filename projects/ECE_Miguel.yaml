Description: 'The Miguel group explores new paradigms such as approximate, stochastic
  and intermittent computing for energy-harvesting IoT devices as well as traditional
  architectures, ranging from microarchitectural topics (e.g., branch prediction,
  value prediction) to cache hierarchies and networks-on-chip for many-core processors.
