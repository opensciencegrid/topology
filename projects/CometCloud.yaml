Description: CometCloud is an autonomic framework for enabling real-world applications
  on dynamically federated, hybrid infrastructure integrating (public & private) clouds,
  data-centers and Grids. Specifically, CometCloud provides abstractions and mechanisms
  to support a range of programming paradigms and real-world applications on such
  an infrastructure. Furthermore, it enables policy-based autonomic cloud-bridging
  and cloud-bursting. Autonomic cloud-bridging enables on-the-fly integration of local
  computational environments (data-centers, grids) and public cloud services (such
  as Amazon EC2), and autonomic cloud-bursting enables dynamic application scale-out
  to address dynamic workloads, spikes in demands, and other extreme requirements.
  Currently, we support various applications as part of our collaborations in multiple
  domains such as medical diagnostics, material sciences, biology, and engineering.
