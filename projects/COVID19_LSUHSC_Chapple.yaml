Description: "Most Bayesian methods require Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling (MCMC)
 to obtain posterior distributions, which can be used  for statistical inference
 - and decision making during adaptive clinical trial designs. To justify any novel
 statistical method or adaptive design, extensive simulation studies must be
 conducted to demonstrate their effectiveness. Dr. Chapple recently used OSG to
 successfully revise a novel statistical method for survival analysis relevant to COVID-19.
 Such simulations, particularly for Bayesian adaptive clinical trials,
 can take a tremendous amount of time to run 1,000 or more simulations for a given
 scenario, and usually hundreds of scenarios are warranted to convince others of the
 trial’s benefit. Dr. Chapple has used 435 thousand core hours to develop clinical
 trial designs for testing safety of new agents in pediatric brain tumors, testing
 multiple COVID-19 therapies simultaneously, and determining optimal treatments
 based on patient subgroups. Without OSG, it would not have been possible to start
 enrolling patients in a 3-treatment armed COVID-19 trial at University Medical
 Center in New Orleans, LA. Based upon that success, Chapple will also demonstrate
 the same approach for 5 treatment arms, and also for subgroups (based on
 comorbidities, age, etc), and publish the trial design in a statistical journal."
