Description: Conducting graduate thesis research on an evolutionary game-theoretic
  model in which games are played sequentially amongst a large population of agents
  distributed over various social network structures. The goal of this research is
  to characterize the population-level social dynamics of the system as social "norms"
  shift to different meta-stable equilibria.
