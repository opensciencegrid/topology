  study the quark-gluon plasma produced in collisions of nuclei. I perform relativistic
  hydrodynamic simulations of the collisions and  study in particular the production
  of photons in the collisions. This is my Vanderbilt website: https://as.vanderbilt.edu/physics-astronomy/bio/jean-francois-paquet/
