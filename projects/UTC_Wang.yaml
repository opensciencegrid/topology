Description: My group develops reliable, data-efficient, and physics-grounded generative
  machine learning methods for imaging and computational anatomy, with a focus on
  robust image reconstruction and analysis under domain shift. We use HPC workflows
  to train and validate these models at scale for clinically relevant imaging tasks.
