Description: "Experiments have shown that co-translational phe\nnomena can strongly\
  \ influence protein function.  A mechanistic understanding of co-translational phenomena\
  \ such as nascent chain tension and protein misfolding can be gained with molecu\n\
  lar dynamics simulations using multi-scale models of ribosome-nascent chain complexes\
  \ (RNCs). Using atomistic and coarse-grained models of RNCs, we will measure the\
  \ magnitude of the mec\nhanical force generated by co-translational folding, determine\
  \ the effects of folding domain size and stability on this force, and investigate\
  \ how codon translation rates can alter the \nprobability of folding and misfolding."
