Description: 'My students and I are planetary scientists who study the planets, moons,  asteroids, and comets of the Solar System as well as other planetary systems with  computational tools from the fields of celestial mechanics, geophysics, and geochemistry.  Our science is driven by big questions: where did our world come from? What other  kinds of worlds are out there? And, how unique is our planet''s history? (www.planetarymakerspace.org)'
