Description: "We aim to pioneer a new era where images of cells become\npowerful,\
  \ rich, unbiased data sources for comparing cell state. We predict that\ndoing so\
  \ will allow rapid and inexpensive interrogation of the impact of genetic\nor chemical\
  \ perturbations on a cell - useful for a variety of important\napplications in biology.\n\
  \nIn morphological profiling, we construct signatures of genes, chemicals, or\n\
  other treatments by measuring the structural changes in treated cells, as\nobserved\
  \ under a microscope. Cells are stained with fluorescent dyes that mark\nseveral\
  \ constituents, producing images from which hundreds of distinct\nmeasurements can\
  \ be extracted at the single cell level. We will carry out\nproof-of-principle computational\
  \ experiments using morphological profiling in\ndiverse and significant applications,\
  \ such as connecting unannotated genes to\nknown pathways, identifying signatures\
  \ of disease, predicting a small molecule\u2019s\nmechanism of action, enriching\
  \ chemical libraries for diverse bioactivity, and\nidentifying new compounds or\
  \ materials with desired phenotypic effects. Despite\nour successes in this field\
  \ so far, the methods development for morphological\nprofiling is a wild frontier:\
  \ novel methods are used but not compared,\nintegration with other data types (such\
  \ as transcriptomics) has not !\nbeen explored, and deep learning is not yet leveraged\
  \ to its potential. We will\ncontinue to push forward the technology development\
  \ needed in our driving\nbiological projects. We will make data and code publicly\
  \ available to catalyze\nthe field. Ultimately, we aim to develop best practices\
  \ for the field and create\nthe foundation for user-friendly, open-source tools\
  \ to discover and quantify\nrelationships among genetic or chemical perturbations\
  \ and disease state, across\na diverse array of biological areas of study and disease\
  \ areas."
