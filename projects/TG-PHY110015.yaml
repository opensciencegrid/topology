Description: We propose to investigate signatures for the discovery of new physics
  at the LHC which would run at a center of mass energy of either 7 TeV, 8 TeV, 10
  TeV or 14 TeV. Our goal is to first study the Standard Model background at these
  energies, and then develop analyses that strongly highlight and discriminate theories
  of new physics. We will use our actively developed software, FastSUSY, to carry
  out Bayesian analyses that estimate the parameters of the various models of new
  physics, in light of the most recent data. We also propose to study topological
  invariants of manifolds that are important in String Theory, searching for correlations
  to algebraic structures relevant to model building, and compute the properties of
  the vacua associated with these geometries. Additionally, we wish to extend our
  analyses to models of supergravity that including CP-violating phases. Our total
  request is for 7 million SUs and 5 TB of disk space for the proposed projects.
