Description: "Hierarchical Approximate Bayesian Computation to Detect Community Response\
  \ to Sea Level Change in the Hawaiian Archipelago. \n\nMethods that integrate population\
  \ sampling from multiple taxa into a single analysis are a much needed addition\
  \ to the comparative phylogeographic toolkit. Here we present a statistical framework\
  \ for multi-species analysis based on hierarchical approximate Bayesian computation\
  \ (hABC) for inferring community dynamics and concerted demographic response. Detecting\
  \ community response to climate change is an important issue with regards to how\
  \ species have and will react to past and future events. Furthermore, whether species\
  \ responded individualistically or in concert is at the center of related questions\
  \ about the abiotic and biotic determinants of community assembly. This method combines\
  \ multi-taxon genetic datasets into a single analysis to determine the proportion\
  \ of a contemporary community that historically expanded in a temporally clustered\
  \ pulse as well as when the pulse occurred. We will apply this method to 59 species\
  \ in the Hawaiian Archip ela! go in order to examine community response of coral\
  \ reef taxa to sea-level change in Hawaii. The method can accommodate dataset heterogeneity\
  \ such as variability in effective population size, mutation rates, and sample sizes\
  \ across species and utilizes borrowing strength from the simultaneous analysis\
  \ of multiple species. This hABC framework used in a multi-taxa demographic context\
  \ can increase our understanding of the impact of historical climate change by determining\
  \ what proportion of the community responded in concert or independently, and can\
  \ be used with a wide variety of comparative phylogeographic datasets as biota-wide\
  \ DNA barcoding data sets accumulate."
