Description: >
  The goal of our research project is to develop a new technique to estimate
  impulse response functions in Time-varying-parameters vector autoregressive models
  (in short: TVP-VARs). TVP-VARs are particularly useful because, unlike traditional
  VAR models, they accounts for changing economic conditions by allowing parameters
  to change over time. Estimating impulse responses (one of the main tools in
  macroeconomic analysis) in a TVP-VAR requires the implementation of Markov Chain
  Montecarlo algorithms (such as Gibbs sampling). This is a computationally demanding
  task in a TVP-VAR framework, due to the huge number of parameters to estimate.
  However, we could substantially ease such task by using parallel computing
  techniques. In this way, we could provide policy makers with a more realistic
  and flexible framework use to perform macroeconomic policy evaluation."
