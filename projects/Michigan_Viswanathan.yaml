Description: "This project seeks to understanding the solvent design rules for efficient\
  \ electrodeposition of cations. By combining molecular dynamics and first-principles\
  \ (DFT) calculations, we want to design cation\u2013anion\u2013solvent\u2013additive\
  \ electrolytes that simultaneously promote metal-oxide ore dissolution and suppress\
  \ parasitic hydrogen evolution primarily by expanding water\u2019s cathodic stability\
  \ window while maintaining efficient metal electrodeposition."
