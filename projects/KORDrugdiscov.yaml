Description: It has been shown that deregulation of the Kappa Opioid Receptor (KOR)
  can contribute to drug abuse and other psychiatric disorders. Therefore, KOR agonists/antagonists
  have become a target for the development of pharmacotherapies for the treatment
  of addiction and other CNS disorders. Unfortunately, few chemical scaffolds have
  been shown to bind selectively to the KOR. Through the use of computational methods,
  we will screen a variety of chemical scaffolds to see how well they bind to the
  active pocket of the KOR and Mu Opioid Receptor. From these results, we will identify
  targets with high binding affinity to Kappa and low binding affinity to Mu. The
  identified compounds will then be screened for in vitro binding affinity to identify
  novel KOR selective ligands.
