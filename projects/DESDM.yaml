Name: DESDM
Description:  The Dark Energy Survey (DES) is about to complete its five-year
  observing program. This consists of a 5000 square-degree wide field
  survey in 5 optical bands of the Southern sky and a 30 square-degree
  deep supernova survey with the aim to understand the nature of Dark
  Energy and the accelerating Universe. DES uses the 3 square-degree CCD
  camera (DECam), installed at the prime focus of the Blanco 4-m to record
  the positions and shapes of 300 million galaxies up to redshift 1.4.
  During a normal night of observations, DES produces about 1 TB of raw
  data, including science and calibration images, which are transported
  automatically from Chile to the National Center for Supercomputing
  Applications in Urbana, Illinois to be archived and reduced. The
  DES Data Management system (DESDM) is in charge of the processing,
  calibration and archiving of these data into science-ready data products
  for analysis by the DES Collaboration and the public.
