Description: Recent experiments demonstrated that by placing a
  molecule inside an optical cavity one can modify ground state
  chemical reactivity. It has been observed that when molecular
  vibrations are strongly coupled to the quantized radiation
  field inside an optical cavity, the chemical kinetics is
  suppressed. The theoretical understanding of such remarkable
  effects remains elusive. In this work, a quantum dynamics
  approach for simulating the vibration-cavity
  (Vibro-Polaritons) hybrid system will be developed.
