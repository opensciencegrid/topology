Description: 'Our study aims to elucidate the differences in the gut microbiome functional
  activity and metabolome in adult premenopausal women with distinctive fitness levels
  and BMIs (with obesity, w/o obesity). The specific aims are as follows -

  Aim 1 - To examine the effects of acute aerobic exercise at 60-70% heart rate reserve
  (HRRmax) for 30 minutes bout on changes in the abundance of SCFA-producing bacteria
  and their functional downstream metabolic activity.

  Aim 2-  To examine the effects of acute aerobic exercise at 60-70% HRRmax 30-minute
  bout on changes in GM-released SCFA concentrations in stool and plasmatic metabolome.'
