Name: CatalystHTVS
Description: Using high throughput computing to screen molecular
  catalysts for energy fuel conversion based on experimental database or in-silico
  generated structures. In the next stage, the output from HTC calculations will
  be used to train machine learning models to allow faster and higher throughput
  molecular catalyst design.
