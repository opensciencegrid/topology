Description: "The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) experiments have successfully discovered\
  \ the last missing piece of the standard model (SM)\u2014the elusive Higgs boson.\
  \ However, no sign of any physics beyond the SM has been observed yet. Although\
  \ the standard model has been extremely effective, many unsolved questions still\
  \ remain.\nThe focus of our group is to study models of physics beyond the SM, which\
  \ tries solve the aforementioned unsolved questions, and explore their possible\
  \ signatures, at LHC experiments predominately. These models include Supersymmetric\
  \ models, Grand Unified Theories, Left-Right Symmetric models and various Dark Matter\
  \ models.\nLHC is going through an upgrade now and it will start functioning again\
  \ next year with increased energy. We are pursuing a number of projects trying to\
  \ predict the possible signature of new physics, pertaining to various models described\
  \ above, in upcoming LHC experiments. Owing to these we need sufficient comuting\
  \ power and intend to run collider simulators including MadGraph, Pythia, PGS, Delphes\
  \ etc."
