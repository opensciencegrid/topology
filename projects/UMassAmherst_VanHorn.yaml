Description: Fine-grained visual classification has blossomed under the advances in
  large-scale image datasets like iNaturalist as well as algorithmic contributions
  like ResNet, ViT, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP, and Multimodal Large
  Language Models (MLLMs). However, VLMs and MLLMs have garnered increased interest
  in FGVC due to the surprising fact that underperform more classical, simpler, and
  smaller approaches. We currently are investigating the root causes and solutions
  for this underperformance, focusing on making sure that VLM/MLLM responses are visually-grounded
  (eg. fine-tuningt), figuring out more faithful ways to evaluate their responses
  (evaluation procedures and benchmarks), and being able to steer predictions with
  expert knowledge (Visipedia).
