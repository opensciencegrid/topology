Description: This project researches thermal-aware, energy-efficient load balancing.
  We collect resource utilization data from machines, process it, and use it to train
  ML models to predict machine temperature and power usage. In our experiments, we
  run many simulations to evaluate the effectiveness of load balancing algorithms.
  Each simulation is computationally complex, utilizing different machine learning
  models for inference, and can be sped up with GPU access.
