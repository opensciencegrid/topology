Description: "Probability-based structural design has now emerged as the most advanced\
  \ methodology to design new and retrofit existing structures in the face of uncertainty.\
  \ The \nfocus of our research lies at the intersection of the areas of structural\
  \ engineering and risk engineering against natural hazards (e.g., earthquakes).\
  \ A large number of computationally-demanding Finite Element simulation jobs need\
  \ to \nbe run as part of our research using open source software (e.g., OpenSees,\
  \ Dakota) and script languages (e.g., Matlab, Python). Thus, the used of high-throughput\
  \ computing resources will be central for the success of our potentially \nhigh-impact\
  \ research on probability-based optimum structural design against natural hazards."
