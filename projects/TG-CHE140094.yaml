Description: Hybridization and denaturation transitions between DNA duplex and single
  stranded forms will be studied using Monte Carlo molecular simulation and a coarse-grained
  model.  Short oligomers, between 10 and 25 bases in length, will be studied for
  one to two sequences, for cases where both strands are in solution as well as where
  one strand is bound to a surface as a model for a DNA microarray.  The effects of
  temperature and of surface binding density will also be studied, and the results
  analyzed in terms of structural effects and hydrogen bonding patterns within the
  duplex.
