Description: The overarching goal of the research to be performed using XSEDE resources
  is to characterize the thermodyanmic and dynamic driving forces  for the behavior
  and properties of systems at the molecular level. This work will involve calculation
  of molecular free energies of transfer between different systems, molecular flow
  in nanoporous materials, determination and refinement of molecular interactions
  in different environments, and simulations of biomolecular systems. One key focus
  of this work will by on optimizing our use of co-processor hardware, the Intel Xeon
  Phi cards in particular, to facilitate our brand of scientific discovery.
