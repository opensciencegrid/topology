Description: Periodic microphases universally emerge in systems for which short-range
  inter-particle attraction is frustrated by long-range repulsion. The morphological
  richness of these phases makes them desirable material targets, but our relatively
  coarse understanding of even simple models limits our grasp of their assembly. The
  OSG computing resources will enable us to explore more solutions of the equilibrium
  phase behavior of a family of similar microscopic microphase formers through specialized
  Monte Carlo simulations.
