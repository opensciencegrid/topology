Description: This project is the computation of gravitational wave fluxes from a binary
  black hole system with an extreme mass ratio, which will be key sources for future
  gravitational-wave space detector LISA. In particular, the focus is calculating
  the contribution of the spin of the smaller black hole to the gravitational waveform.
