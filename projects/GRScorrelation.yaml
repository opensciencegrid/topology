Description: 'We calculate the autocorrelation merit factors for Golay-Shapiro-Rudin-like
  sequences and the crosscorrelation merit factors for pairs of such sequences. Each
  of the 2^n seed sequences of length n gives rise to an infinite family of sequences,
  and we have asymptotic formulas (see our preprint at arXiv: 1702.07697 [math.NT])
  for the merit factors based on calculations involving only the seeds. The number
  of seeds grows exponentially, thus making this a project that is well-suited to
  distributed computing. We would like to extend Table 2 of our paper (minimum combined
  measure of autocorrelation and crosscorrelation, unconstrained search) to seeds
  of length 28. And we would like to extend Tables 1 and 3 of our paper (minimum autocorrelation
  and minimum combined measure among those sequences of minimum autocorrelation) to
  seeds of length 52, because we have a conjectue that something interesting may happen
  at length 52. We expect that the extension of T!

  ables 1 and 3 will require about 130,000 runs, each of which would take about an
  hour each on a single thread of a typical workstation. And we expect that the extension
  of Table 2 will require about 45,000 runs taking about 45 minutes each in a similar
  situation.'
