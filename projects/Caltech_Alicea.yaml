Description: "The project explores state-of-the-art Hartree-Fock simulations of interacting\
  \ graphene multilayers.  Simulation work is part of a joint theory/experiment effort\
  \ done in collaboration with Stevan Nadj-Perge\u2019s group at Caltech and aims\
  \ to explain their spectroscopy measurements."
