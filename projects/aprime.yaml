Description: 'DarkLight experiment planned to run at Jefferson LAB in the upcoming
  years will search for a massive photon possibly produced in interaction of an electron
  with electric filed of a proton.


  Monte-Carlo simulations are needed design and optimize the Darklight experiment.
  The initial OSG-Connect resources of few CPU years will be sufficient. The simulation
  will use CERN libraries, namely: Geant4.10, root5.34, compiled on Scientific Linux
  6.5.'
