Description: 'Scientific researchers need reproducible software environments for complex
  applications that can run across heterogeneous computing platforms. Modern open
  source tools, like Pixi, provide automatic reproducibility solutions for all dependencies
  while providing a high level interface well suited for researchers.


  This in-person workshop will provide a practical introduction to using Pixi to easily
  create computing environments for scientific and AI/ML workflows that benefit from
  hardware acceleration, across multiple machines and platforms. The focus will be
  on applications using Python machine learning libraries with CUDA enabled, as well
  as deploying these environments to production settings in Linux container images.
  This workshop will not teach machine learning concepts, but will focus on the methodologies
  and tools to make existing machine learning workflows reproducible.'
