Description: >
  Computational stellar models are widely used in astrophysics and are often consulted to interpret observations of starlight.
  My research group aims to improve stellar models by incorporating updated physics into the models, creating a database of 
  stellar models for use by other researchers, and to use these improved stellar models to study a variety of issues related 
  to galactic archelogy and the formation of galaxies. https://stellar.host.dartmouth.edu
