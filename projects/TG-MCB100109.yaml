Description: 'The purpose of this proposal is to renew our XRAC Allocation TG-MCB100109.
  During the past year, this allocation has provided us with sufficient resources
  to further optimize our weighted ensemble path sampling software for the efficient
  simulation of rare events and to apply the software to the simulation of association
  kinetics for a model protein-peptide system (the MDM2-p53 peptide complex). We now
  request a larger allocation to enable the application of the weighted ensemble approach
  to explicit solvent simulations of binding events for a model protein-protein complex
  (barnase-barstar complex) with rigorous calculation of association rates. This allocation
  will also enable the QM/MM simulations of a diffusion-controlled chemical reaction
  in solution (the addition of azide ion to a series of triphenylmethyl-derived cations)
  with the aid of the weighted ensemble approach. These applications will be important
  milestones two grand challenges in computational chemistry: 1) the simulation of
  protein binding events, and 2) the simulation of chemical reactions in solution.
  It would not be possible to make meaningful progress on these simulations without
  the requested allocation on the XSEDE resources.'
