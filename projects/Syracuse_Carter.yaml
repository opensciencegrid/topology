Description: "This project is focused on automated re-processing of hydrographic survey\
  \ data catalogued in the USACE eHydro database. Currently, the USACE employs deterministic\
  \ TINs for creating bathymetric surfaces to inform dredging practices which is prone\
  \ to producing artifacts. With improved geostatistical methods (kriging, radial\
  \ basis functions, tension splines, etc.), the USACE can potentially improve dredge\
  \ operation planning by having a more accurate model of bathymetry across the nation\u2019\
  s largest coastal waterways. eHydro as a reference: https://www.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/4b8f2ba307684cf597617bf1b6d2f85d"
