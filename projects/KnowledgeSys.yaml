Description: "In educational assessment, several questions must be answered when constructing\
  \ a test, such as \u201CHow many items are necessary for adequate knowledge measurement\
  \ precision?\u201D, \u201CHow many field-test students are needed to adequately\
  \ calibrate model parameters?\u201D, or \u201CWhich computerized adaptive testing\
  \ (CAT) algorithm performs best?\u201D For complex non-linear models, these questions\
  \ are typically approached by simulation: Model parameters are calibrated (as if\
  \ unknown) from simulated student item responses, or the emergent properties of\
  \ particular CAT algorithms are investigated with a large number of simulated test\
  \ takers. Since the design space grows quickly, many simulations are necessary to\
  \ understand general trends.\n\nMatch-for-OSG:\n\nSimulations throughout the test\
  \ design space can be run independently, requiring little coordination between cores.\
  \ Computations generally do not have high memory requirements or unusual library/code\
  \ dependencies, and computations can be recovered from checkpoints easily. The large\
  \ number of simulations suggests parallel computing, but the independence allows\
  \ an asynchronous, distributed environment, such as OSG."
