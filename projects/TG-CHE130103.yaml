Description: Energy transport in disordered systems coupled to a thermal environment
  is a topic that is exceedingly important for a diverse set of technological applications
  including organic photovoltaic solar cells, conducting polymers and a host of others.
  Unfortunately, at present the dynamics in these systems is not well understood.
  The primary difficulty is that one must accurately simulate the dynamics of relatively
  large open quantum systems over lengthy timescales and across a broad range of parameters.
  Here we request XSEDE resources to focus on two specific questions on the energy
  transport process that will provide both key fundamental insights, as well as useful
  design principles to guide the construction of more efficient materials. First,
  we extend the results of our previous allocation to examine the energy transport
  in two dimensional thin films with realistic dipolar interactions. These systems
  are expected to undergo a metal-insulator (Anderson) transition as a function of
  both the orientation of the molecular dipoles and the strength of disorder. Simulations
  will be performed to elucidate this phase diagram. Secondly, the nature of the transport
  in the weak system-bath coupling regime will be explored, wherein the dynamics are
  largely governed by coherent, quantum effects. The scaling properties of the transport
  in this regime will be determined, providing insights into the interplay of Anderson
  localization with the dynamics of open quantum systems.
