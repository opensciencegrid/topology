Description: 'We are developing a implementation of a Monte Carlo volume rendering
  method. The primary purpose is to impro

  ve the calculation of multiple scattering physics, with possible applications in
  computer graphics, nuclear physics, and remote s

  ensing. The project involves the numerical calculation of a Feynman path integral,
  which is what most of the computation is devot

  ed to, and the primary need for high throughput computing methods.'
