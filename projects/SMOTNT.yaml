Description: 'Current model tracks the status of every single mRNA,
ribosome, tRNA molecules during transcription and translation processes. The
activities of these molecules are mainly governed by experimentally determined
parameters such as their abundances and diffusion rates, as well as
gene-specific rates for transcription, mRNA decay and translation.'
