Description: "Program uses NCBI\u2019s Entrez.efetch on the nucleotide database to\
  \ take in large number of sequences and searches the sequences for palindromes ranging\
  \ in size from 4 to 20 and appends the results to a list. The program then takes\
  \ each palindrome and checks for its occurrence on the 11 genes of the influenza\
  \ A virus\u2019s and outputs every match of the palindrome with relevant sequence\
  \ Information."
