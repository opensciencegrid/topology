Description: IceCube is a neutrino detector built at the South Pole by instrumenting
  about a cubic kilometer of ice with 5160 light sensors. IceCube is taking data since
  2006, and it is envisioned to continuing doing so for the next 20 years. One of
  the primary goals for IceCube is to elucidate the mechanisms for production of high-energy
  cosmic rays by detecting high-energy neutrinos from astrophysical sources. The excellent
  performance of IceCube plus the advances in understanding fundamental detector characteristics
  such as the ice properties have allowed to expand its scientific reach towards measurements
  and searches that require much higher precision and control of systematic error
  sources. Examples of these are the measurement of neutrino oscillations in a previously
  unexplored energy range from 10 to 60 GeV. The simulations proposed in this request
  will enable carrying out neutrino physics precision analysis which require of a
  very good understanding of possible sources of systematic errors. Examples of these
  are Tau neutrino appearance and Muon neutrino disappearance precision measurements
  as well as searches for low energy sterile neutrinos.
