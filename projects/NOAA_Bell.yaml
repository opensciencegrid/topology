  Water column sonar data, the acoustic back-scatter from the near surface to the seafloor, are used to assess physical and biological characteristics of the ocean including the spatial distribution of plankton, fish, methane seeps, and underwater oil plumes. Currently our catalog includes 270 TB of data that we are working to convert from a proprietary industry format into a cloud native Zarr format.
