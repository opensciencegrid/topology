Department: 'Sea Level Solutions Center, Institute of Environment '
Description: We conduct research on sea level variability using AI/ML methods with
  a range of contributing factors based on tide gauges and satellites and model based
  reanalysis data. Also, we analyze both global and regional climate model outputs
  to understand future conditions and their impacts on urban and natural environments.
