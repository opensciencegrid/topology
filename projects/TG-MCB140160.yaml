Description: "Description: RNA aptamers are small oligonucleotide molecules (~100\
  \ nucleotides) whose composition and resulting folded structure enable them to bind\
  \ with high affinity and high selectivity to specific target ligands and therefore\
  \ hold great promise as potential therapeutic drugs. The first aptamer to receive\
  \ FDA approval was pegaptanib (Macugen), which is a treatment for wet age-related\
  \ macular degeneration, a degenerative disease of the macula of the eye that leads\
  \ to the loss of central vision. The pegaptanib aptamer acts by binding to and inhibiting\
  \ the action of an isoform of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), arresting\
  \ degeneration. Functional aptamers are selected from a large, randomized initial\
  \ library in a process known as SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential\
  \ enrichment). This is an iterative process involving numerous rounds of binding,\
  \ elution, and amplification against a specific target substrate. During each iteration\
  \ - or round of selection - we enrich for the species with the highest binding affinity\
  \ to the target. After multiple rounds, we ideally have an enriched aptamer library\
  \ suitable for subsequent investigation. Modern techniques employ massively parallel\
  \ sequencing, enabling the generation of large libraries (~10^{6} sequences) in\
  \ a matter of hours for each round of selection. As RNA is single-stranded, the\
  \ covariance model (CM) approach (Eddy, SR, Durbin, R (1994). RNA sequence analysis\
  \ using covariance models. Nucleic Acids Res., 22, 11:2079-88) are ideal for representing\
  \ motifs in their secondary structures, allowing us to discover patterns within\
  \ functional aptamer populations following each round. CMs have been implemented\
  \ in 'Infernal' (http://infernal.janelia.org)  a program that infers RNA alignments\
  \ based on RNA sequence and structure. Calibrating a single CM in Infernal however\
  \ can take several hours and is a significant performance bottleneck for our work.\
  \ However, as each CM calculation is itself independently determined and requires\
  \ defined pr!\n ocessing\n and memory resources, their computation in parallel using\
  \ the Open Science Grid offers a potential solution to this problem. Using part\
  \ of a Campus Champion award to our institution, we have prototyped such a solution\
  \ by making use of the Simple API for Grid Applications (SAGA) to interface with\
  \ OSG and manage job submissions and file transfers. When run in parallel, our results\
  \ showed a significant speed up, constrained by typical latencies and QoS associated\
  \ with nominal OSG usage. This prior study demonstrated the feasibility of using\
  \ SAGA and the OSG to support the parallelization of CM analysis of such large scale\
  \ sequence based aptamer libraries, and forms the basis of this startup allocation\
  \ request to further constrain workflow productivity and support the PhD research\
  \ of Mr. Kevin Shieh."
