Description: This project uses the stellar evolution code MESA (Modules for Experiments
  in Stellar Astrophysics) to model stars undergoing varying amounts of mass accretion
  across a range of initial masses. By evolving large grids of one-dimensional stellar
  models with detailed microphysics, I examine how accretion alters internal structure,
  chemical composition profiles, and long-term evolutionary outcomes. The results
  help constrain how mass transfer histories shape observable stellar properties and
  the formation of compact remnants. See https://benjaminroulston.com/research
