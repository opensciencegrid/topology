Description: This course will provide an overview of techniques in
  cluster computing, High Throughput Computing and High Performance
  computing. Students will start from the very basics of constructing a
  small two node cluster from first principles. Using this small cluster,
  students will learn a variety of topics about cluster configuration and
  management, files systems and how they affect workflows, constructing
  workflows, running applications locally and how to scale applications
  to larger systems. Initially the students will do most of their work on
  their two node clusters. We will then scale the workflows and run them
  using the University of Colorado High Energy Physics cluster; an OSG
  opportunistic resource provider (UColorado_HEP) and finally I would like
  to give the students the experience if running on very large systems. I
  do not envision the students needing high priority nor consuming large
  amounts of resources. I am much more interested in being able to provide
  the experience of "what is possible". The class will consist of between
  30 and 40 students. Funding for this class comes from the United States
  State Department through the Fulbright Scholar Program.
