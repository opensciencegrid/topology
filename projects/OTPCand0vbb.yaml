Description: "PSEC group at the University of Chicago is developing Large-Area Picosecond\
  \ Photo-Detectors (LAPPDs). By reconstructing the arrival position and time of photons\
  \ produced in water or liquid scintillator on highly segmented fast photo-detectors\
  \ such as LAPPDs one can reconstruct tracks by using the `drift time' of photons,\
  \ much as one does\nwith electrons in a Time Projection Chamber. We are developing\
  \ new event reconstruction techniques for large water and liquid scintillator detectors.\
  \ For example see A. Elagin et al., \u201CSeparating Double-Beta Decay Events from\
  \ Solar Neutrino Interactions in a Kiloton-Scale Liquid Scintillator Detector by\
  \ Fast Timing\u201D, Nucl. Instr. Meth. Phys. Res. A849 (2017) 102."
