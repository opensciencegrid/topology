Description: I am interested in examining experience-dependent neuroplasticity and individual differences in humans as it pertains to learning and memory.  In particular, I analyze structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) data from various neuroimaging data-sharing platforms to explore changes in gray matter across learning and/or correlate learning performance with various cognitive and demographic factors.
