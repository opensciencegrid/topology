Description: 'The work proposed is Monte Carlo modeling of the interaction between
  mobile and sta-

  tionary phases as they relate to supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC). Proposed
  research

  continues that done with the startup allocation, which involved writing, testing,
  and porting

  Monte Carlo code to model intermolecular interactions and fluid phase equilibria
  in com-

  pressed carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is the main component of the mobile phase
  in SFC,

  which typically operates at temperatures and and pressures above the critical point.
  The

  objective of the proposed work is an understanding at the molecular level of the
  interac-

  tion between mobile-phase molecules and the alkylsilane-coated silica stationary
  phase. The

  computational method is Monte Carlo simulation, mainly in the constant-pressure
  Gibbs

  ensemble. Hybrid molecular dynamics moves will be used for alklylsilane chains.
  Proposed

  calculations will survey four alkylsilane coatings, eight pressures, three temperatures,
  and

  three mobile-phase compositions. Compositions will be pure carbon dioxide and carbon

  dioxide modified with 5% or 10% methanol. XSEDE resources requested are service
  units

  on the Open Science Grid, which suits the small portable nature of the Monte Carlo
  code.

  Weeks-long runs will be achieved by automatic resubmission of jobs.'
