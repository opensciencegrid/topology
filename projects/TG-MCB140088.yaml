Description: "The molecules of life are large, complex machines that drive the operations\
  \ of the cell. Modeling the atomic structure and underlying dynamics of these molecules\
  \ is critical for understanding disease and developing therapeutics. Recent advances\
  \ in experimental instrumentation and scientific software have have made high resolution\
  \ biological structures more accessible than ever, but large data volumes and complex\
  \ calculation often require extensive computation. Cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-EM),\
  \ for example, can now reveal structures from heterogeneous biological samples to\
  \ atomic resolution - better than 3 angstroms. These structures require terabytes\
  \ of experimental data and upwards of 20,000 hours of compute time for accurate\
  \ determinations to be made. X-ray crystallography, the workhorse of structural\
  \ biology, can now combine complex computational modeling algorithms like Rosetta\
  \ with experimental data to arrive at a complete structure determination, which\
  \ may require more than 1000 hours of compute time. Drug discovery efforts have\
  \ embraced computational \u201Cvirtual screening\u2019 to filter the most likely\
  \ targets from vast drug fragment libraries by combining computational chemistry\
  \ and experimentally-determined molecular structures. In these screens, the only\
  \ limit to the number of drug candidates screened is computational time.  Finally,\
  \ molecular dynamics simulations give insight into the motions biological molecules\
  \ adopt as they perform their jobs, but also require high-performance computing\
  \ resources for meaningful results. As a Campus Champion at Harvard Medical School\
  \ and SBGrid, I support the research computing needs of a diverse structural biology\
  \ community and XSEDE is an essential resource in driving this critical research."
